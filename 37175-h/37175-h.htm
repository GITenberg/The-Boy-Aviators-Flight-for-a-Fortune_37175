<h1>The Boy Aviators’ Flight for a Fortune</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I.—ON BRIG ISLAND.</h2>
<p>
The sharp bow of Zenas Daniels’ green and
red dory grazed the yellow beach on the west
shore of Brig Island, a wooded patch of land
lying about a mile off the Maine Shore in the
vicinity of Casco Bay. His son Zeb, a lumbering,
uncouth-looking lad of about eighteen, with
a pronounced squint, leaped from the craft as it
was beached, and seized hold of the frayed
painter preparatory to dragging her farther up
the beach.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Zenas himself, brown and
hatchetlike of face, and lean of figure—with a
tuft of gray whisker on his sharp chin, like an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
old-fashioned knocker on a mahogany door—gathered
up a pile of lobster pots from the stern
of the dory and shouldered them. A few lay
loose, and those he flung out on the beach.
</p>
<p>
These last Zeb gathered up, and as his father
stepped out of the dory the pair began trudging
up the steeply sloping beach, toward the woods
which rimmed the islet almost to the water’s
edge. All this, seemingly, in defiance of a staring
sign which faced them, for on it was printed
in letters visible quite a distance off:
</p>
<div class='center'>
<p>PRIVATE PROPERTY.</p>
<p>NO TRESPASSING!</p>
</div>
<p>
Instead, however, of checking the fisherman,
it caused old Zenas to break into a harsh laugh
as his deep-set, wrinkle-surrounded eyes dwelt
for an instant on the inscription. His jaw
seemed to set with a snap, and his thin lips
formed a narrow, hairlike line as a second later
he saw something else. This was a stout wire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
fence, clearly of recent construction, which extended
along the edge of the woods. Apparently
it must have encircled the island, for it ran as
far as eye could see in either direction.
</p>
<p>
“Waal, I’ll be dummed-gosh dummed!”
snorted Zenas, his thin nostrils dilating angrily.
</p>
<p>
“Put up a fence now, have they?” he continued.
“Waal, if thet ain’t ther beatingest! A
passel of city kids ter come hyar and think they
kin run things in Casco Bay!”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon thet fence ain’t goin’ ter hinder us
powerful much, dad.”
</p>
<p>
“Waal, I swan <em>not</em>. Come on, Zeb, look lively
with them pots; we’ve got ter git across ther
island an’ back ez slippy ez we kin.”
</p>
<p>
But as father and son resumed their journey,
the thick brush suddenly parted and down a narrow
path a boyish figure came suddenly into
view. The newcomer was a tall, muscular
youth, with a face tanned to a healthy brown by
constant outdoor life. His clean-cut figure and
frank, open countenance formed a striking contrast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
to Zenas’ crabbed features and the shifty
look of his son.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you intend going?” demanded the
boy, as he halted a few paces on the opposite
side of the fence.
</p>
<p>
“You know waal enough, Frank Chester, or
whatever yer name is,” growled out Zenas,
“we’re goin’ across ther Island ter stow our
lobster pots, just as we’ve bin a-doin’ fer years.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m very sorry. I don’t want to seem unfair,
but, as I explained to you the other day,
this island is now private property. It was rented
from Mr. Dunning of Portland on the express
condition that we were not to be interfered
with.”
</p>
<p>
“Land o’ Goshen! So ye think yer kin come
hyar an’ run things ter suit yerselves, do yer?”
</p>
<p>
“We rented the island for that purpose. As
I said before, we are all very sorry if it interferes
with your convenience; but there’s Woody
Island half a mile below, and closer in to Motthaven,
too, why won’t that suit you as well?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
“’Cos it won’t. Thet’s why. Brig Island’s bin
here a sight longer than you er I, and it’s goin’
ter stay hyar arter we’re gone, too.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t quite see what that has to do with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Waal, I do. We ain’t used ter bein’ dictated
to by a passel of kids. I’ve bin usin’ this island
fer ten years or more. It suits me first rate, and
I propose ter go on using it, and ther ain’t no
kids kin stop me,” spoke Zenas stubbornly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we shan’t keep you from it for more
than a few weeks at most—at least I hope so,”
rejoined Frank, with perfect good nature, “after
that, although we have leased it for a year, we
shall be glad to have you use it in any way you
like.”
</p>
<p>
“I want ter use it right now, I tell yer.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you can’t!”
</p>
<p>
Frank’s control of himself was beginning to
ooze away in the face of such mule-like obstinacy.
</p>
<p>
“Kain’t, eh? We’ll see. You’re alone on the
island ter-day, I seen ther other kids go ashore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
this mornin’. Come on, Zeb, climb over thet
fence.”
</p>
<p>
“Thet’s right, dad,” applauded Zeb, “ef he
gives yer any sass jes’ hit him a clip in ther jaw.
Reckon that ’ull stop him fer a while.”
</p>
<p>
As his son spoke Zenas made as if to lay his
hand on the top wire of the fence preparatory
to scaling it. Frank Chester stepped hastily forward.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t try to climb that fence!” he warned.
His tone was so earnest that, involuntarily, Zenas
checked himself.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Because if you do you are going to get hurt.
I give you fair warning.”
</p>
<p>
“Shucks! ez if a kid could bother me. Come
on, Zeb.”
</p>
<p>
As he called to his son, Zenas clapped his hand
on the top wire. Zeb, with a contemptuous grimace
at Frank, did the same.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll show yer——” Zeb was beginning,
when a singular thing happened.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<a name='i002' id='i002'></a>
<img src="images/illus-010.jpg" alt="“OUCH! WHAT IN THE NAME OF TIME HIT US!”" title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>“OUCH! WHAT IN THE NAME OF TIME HIT US!”</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>
Zenas, with a yell, sprang into the air and,
tripping as he came down, alighted in a sprawling
heap among the freshly-tarred lobster pots.
His gray goatee wagged savagely as he lay there
impotently clenching his fists, alternating this
performance by vigorously rubbing his elbows.
In the meantime his son, giving vent to a no less
piercing cry, had executed a backward bound
from the fence with as much velocity as if he
had been a rubber ball.
</p>
<p>
“Ouch! What in ther name of time hit us!”
he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Dear land o’ Goshen! What was thet?”
shouted his parent.
</p>
<p>
Frank had some difficulty in steadying his
voice to reply. The sight of the two lately militant
figures sprawling there on the beach was
too much for his gravity.
</p>
<p>
“<em>That</em>,” he managed to gasp out at length,
“that was a <em>mild</em> current of electricity running
through those wires. You recollect I warned you
not to touch them.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
</p>
<p>
“You—you—you young villain!” roared Zenas,
springing to his feet with great agility for
one of his years, “I’ll have ther law on yer!”
</p>
<p>
“Consarn you, yes!” echoed Zeb, “assault and
battery!”
</p>
<p>
“No, not batteries—a dynamo,” Frank could
not resist saying. “If you think of going to law
over it,” he added, more seriously, “please recollect
that I warned you not to touch those wires.
Furthermore, you were defiantly trespassing on
private property, although you could see that
sign from quite a distance out on the water.”
</p>
<p>
The elder Daniels’ face was a study at this.
But his son continued to bellow angrily.
</p>
<p>
“You may hev injured dad and me fer life!”
he shouted.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no; on the contrary, a mild shock of electricity
is a fine thing for the system. But,” and
Frank smiled, “don’t take an overdose.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, y’er laughin’ at us, are yer? Waal, maybe
ther laugh ’ull be on the other side of yer
face nex’ time we meet.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
All this time the elder Daniels had remained
silent, gathering up his scattered lobster pots.
Evidently he did not meditate a second assault
on the fence. Now he turned the overboiling
vials of his wrath on his son.
</p>
<p>
“Pick up them pots, consarn ye!” he rumbled
throatily, “and git out ’er this.”
</p>
<p>
Zeb obeyed, and then, with what dignity they
could muster, the two shuffled back down the
beach to their dory. Then they shoved off and
began pulling for Woody Island. Frank Chester
watched them in silence. But they did not
look his way once during the swift row. When
they landed on the distant islet, he saw Zeb turn
and shake his fist in the direction of Brig Island
with vicious emphasis. The elder fisherman,
however, simply strode off along the beach of
the adjacent island without turning.
</p>
<p>
“Well, the fence certainly served its purpose,”
said Frank to himself, as he turned away; “it
proved as effectual as it did that night we used
the same sort of contrivance to put to rout the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
rascals who wanted to wreck the old Golden
Eagle. Sorry I had to give those fellows such a
severe lesson, though. They liked us little
enough before. They’ll have still less use for us
now.”
</p>
<p>
He was about to retrace his steps up the path
when his attention was arrested by a sudden
sound—the sharp “put-put-put!” of a motor boat.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bet that’s Harry, Billy and Pudge coming
now!” he exclaimed. “I’ll go round to the
hulk and meet them.”
</p>
<p>
So saying, he started off along the beach. In
a few seconds he rounded a wooded promontory
and passed out of sight. Right here, perhaps, is
a good place to give those readers who have not
already formed their acquaintance, some further
idea of who Frank Chester and his companions
are, and how the quartet came to be on Brig Island,
off the coast of Maine, in the island-dotted
Casco Bay region.
</p>
<p>
The first volume of this series related the adventures
of Frank and Harry Chester, two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
bright, inventive New York lads of seventeen and
sixteen, in the turbulent Central American Republic
of Nicaragua. In this book was set down
the part that their aëroplane, <em>The Golden Eagle</em>,
played in the drama of revolution, and followed
also the tempestuous career of their chum Billy
Barnes, a young reporter whom they met in the
tropics. Mr. Chester, a New York man of affairs,
owned a plantation in Nicaragua, and the
boys and their aëroplane were the means of saving
this from the depredations of the revolutionaries.
But in an electric storm in which she
was driven out to sea the <em>Golden Eagle</em> was lost.
By means of the wireless apparatus with which
she was equipped, the lads, however, managed to
communicate with a steamer which picked them
up and saved their lives.
</p>
<p>
In The Boy Aviators on Secret Service, the
second volume of the Boy Aviators’ series, we
find them in the mysterious region of the Everglades.
Once again they demonstrated—this
time for Uncle Sam—the almost limitless possibilities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
of the two greatest inventions of modern
times—the aëroplane and wireless telegraphy.
In this book we related how the secret
explosive factory was located and put out of
commission, and what dangers and difficulties
surrounded the boys during the process.
</p>
<p>
Not long after this a strange combination of
circumstances resulted in the boys taking a voyage
to Africa. In The Boy Aviators In Africa
you may read how they discovered the ivory
hoard in the Moon Mountains, and how the
Arab slave trader, who had cause to fear them,
made all sorts of trouble for them. The first
aëroplane to soar above the trackless forests of
the Dark Continent conveyed them safely out
of their dilemmas, and indirectly was the cause
of their being able to voyage back to America
on a fine yacht.
</p>
<p>
The boys had figured on resting up after this,
but the love of adventure that stirred in their
blood, as well as their warm friendship for Billy
Barnes, prompted them to take part in a cross-continent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
flight against great odds. The story of
the contest, The Boy Aviators in Record Flight,
related stirring incidents from coast to coast.
Readers of that volume will readily summon to
mind the ruse by which the lads escaped the cowboys
and baffled some renegade Indians and,
finally, their fearful battle in midair with the
sand storm.
</p>
<p>
The story of an old Spanish galleon enthralled
in the deadly grip of the Sargasso Sea furnished
the inspiration for the tale of the Boy Aviators’
Treasure Quest. But they were not alone on
their hunt for the long-lost treasure trove. Luther
Barr, a bad old man who had caused them
much trouble before, fitted out a rival expedition.
High above the vast ocean of Sargasso
weed the boys had to fight for their lives with
a crew of desperate men in a powerful dirigible
craft. How they won out, and through what
other adventures they passed—including the surprising
one of the “rat ship,”—you must read the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
volume to discover, as we have not space to detail
all that befell them on that voyage.
</p>
<p>
Then came what was, in many respects, their
queerest voyage of all—the flight above the Antarctic
fields of eternal ice, in search of the goal
of discoverers of half a dozen nationalities, the
South Pole. The Boy Aviators’ Polar Dash was
a volume full of swift action and enterprise.
Many hardships were endured and dangers faced,
but the boys did not flinch when duty required
their best of them. They emerged from the
frozen regions having achieved a signal triumph,
but one which would not have been possible of
accomplishment without their aëroplane.
</p>
<p>
Having thus briefly sketched the previous careers
of the Boy Aviators, we shall give a short
account of how they came to be on Brig Island,
and then press on with our story. About a
month before the present story opens then, a
scientific friend of Mr. Chester’s, Dr. Maxim
Perkins, had called on the Boy Aviators’ father
and requested the aid of the young aërial inventors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
in some problems that were bothering
him. Dr. Perkins was already an aviator of
some note, but his achievements had not found
their way into the newspapers as, like most scientific
men, he did not care for publicity in connection
with his experiments.
</p>
<p>
In common with the rest of the civilized world
Dr. Perkins—horrified at a mid-ocean tragedy
in which hundreds of lives were sacrificed—had
set his wits to work to devise some means of
life saving—in addition to the regular boat equipment—which
might be easily carried by ocean
liners. He was convinced that it would be feasible
for vessels of that description to carry an
auxiliary fleet of what he termed “dirigible-hydro-aëroplanes.”
By this rather clumsy name
he meant a combination of the hydroplane, dirigible
and aëroplane. But although his ideas on
the subject were clear enough in theory, he was
rather hazy about the practical side of the matter,
and this was the object of his call on Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
Chester—to ask the aid of the Boy Aviators in
carrying out his experiments.
</p>
<p>
To make a long story short, arrangements
were finally completed by which the doctor had
leased Brig Island, and had set up on it such
sheds and appliances as would be needed by the
boys in their work. These included a wireless,
by means of which communication with the mainland
might be kept up—via Portland—and also a
unique piece of apparatus (if such it could be
called) of which we shall learn in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>
The boys had now spent two busy weeks on
the island, and the work that they had mapped
out for themselves was so nearly completed that
they had felt justified that morning in wirelessing
Dr. Perkins to come and see how things
were going on. As we have seen, their stay on
the island had not been altogether tranquil. The
spot had been used for years by the fishermen
as a sort of stowage place for their apparatus,
and also, sometimes, as a summer residence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
With the coming of the boys and their necessarily
private work, all this had been changed,
and the resentment of the fishermen had been
bitter. Of all the complainers, Zenas and his
son were the most aggressive, however, and
had openly threatened to drive the boys off the
island.
</p>
<p>
To avoid being taken by surprise the lads had
rigged up the electric fence, which device, as
readers of The Boy Aviators on Secret Service
will recall, had been used by them before with
success to repel unwelcome visitors.
</p>
<p>
Let us now rejoin Frank Chester as he goes
to meet the approaching motor boat on which
his brother Harry, Billy Barnes and Pudge Perkins,
the doctor’s son, had visited the mainland
for provisions and mail that morning.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II.—THE WIRELESS.</h2>
<p>
As Frank rounded the point, the waves almost
lapping his feet as he edged along the rocky
promontory, he came into full view of the
adjunct to the little settlement which was mentioned
in the preceding chapter. This was nothing
more nor less than the hulk of what had once
been a fair-sized schooner. But her masts had
vanished, and on her decks nothing now rose
above the bulwarks but a towering structure of
sufficiently odd form to have set the wits of
every man in Motthaven who had seen it at
their keenest edge.
</p>
<p>
This structure began about amidships, where
it attained a height of some thirty feet. From
thence its skeleton form sloped sharply down
toward the stern of the dismantled hulk, much
in the manner of the “Chute the Chutes” familiar to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
most lads throughout the land from
their having seen them at amusement resorts.
The old schooner—formerly rejoicing in the
name of <em>Betsy Jane</em>—had been picked up for a
song in Portland by the Boy Aviators, who saw
in it exactly what they needed for a bit of experimental
apparatus. At their orders the inclined
“slide” had been built, and when this was
accomplished the craft had been towed into the
cove, where it now lay anchored by a stout line,
about 200 yards off shore.
</p>
<p>
As Frank came into view of the black old hull,
swinging on her mooring line on the turning tide,
a “Hampton” motor boat came chugging round
the <em>Betsy Jane’s</em> stern. In it were three lads.
The one in the bow handling the wheel is already
familiar to our readers, who will at once recognize
the cherubic, smiling features of the spectacled
Billy Barnes. In the stern, tending to the
engine—a five horse power one of the make-and-break
type—was Harry Chester, Frank’s younger
brother, and standing amidships, waving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
cheerfully to Frank, was a youth best described
as being “tubby” of build, with round rosy
cheeks and a most good-natured expression of
countenance.
</p>
<p>
This last lad was Ulysses—otherwise “Pudge”
Perkins, the son of the aërial scientist who had
sent the lads on their strange mission.
</p>
<p>
“Batter and butterflies!” he shouted, as the
boat drew closer and he spied Frank, “how are
you, Frank? Get lonely without your chums?”
</p>
<p>
“No; I rather enjoyed myself,” laughed back
Frank, shouting his words across the water;
“you see, while you were away I had some quiet,
and a chance to work out a few problems.”
</p>
<p>
“Mumps and mathematics!” sputtered Pudge
amiably, “you don’t mean to say I worry you,
Frank?”
</p>
<p>
By this time the motor boat had approached
close to her mooring, at which swung a small
boat of the dory type. The motor boat was
speedily made fast, and the boyish occupants
tumbled into the small boat and Harry rapidly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
sculled them ashore. Before leaving the motor
boat some sacks of supplies had been thrown in,
and the small craft was so heavily laden that
Pudge had to be sternly warned to keep still on
peril of swamping it.
</p>
<p>
“Dories and dingbats! as if my sylphlike form
could bother this staunch craft! Yo-ho! my
lads, yo-ho! pull for the shore and don’t bother
about me.”
</p>
<p>
The beach was reached without catastrophe,
and while Frank helped the others unload the
supplies he told them of what had occurred during
their absence.
</p>
<p>
“After you left,” he said, “I got busy figuring
on that plane problem. All at once I heard
voices, and by listening I soon recognized them
as Zenas Daniels and that precious son of his.
As I knew what ugly customers they were I
turned the current into the fence and sauntered
down toward the shore. Sure enough it was
Zenas and Zeb and they tried to rush the fence.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
Frank then went on to tell of what had happened.
Shouts of laughter greeted his narrative.
</p>
<p>
“Sugar and somersaults! But I’d have liked
to see those chaps do a flip-flap,” chuckled the
rotund Pudge, hugging himself in his joy.
</p>
<p>
“I guess Zenas must have learned that electricity
is good for the rheumatiz,” laughed Billy
Barnes gleefully; “I’d like to have had a picture
of them when they hit the wire,” he added,
swinging his inevitable camera at the end of its
carrying straps.
</p>
<p>
“It would have been worth while,” laughed
Harry; “but come on, boys, let’s get this stuff up
to the hut. Anything to eat, Frank? I’m hungry
enough to swallow one of old Zenas’ lobster
pots.”
</p>
<p>
“Sandwiches and sauerkraut! So am I,”
chimed in Pudge.
</p>
<p>
“Great Scott!” cried Billy Barnes, “as if we
didn’t know that. If you told us you <em>weren’t</em>
hungry it would be something new.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t see where I’ve got anything on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
you when it comes to meal times,” retorted the
fat youth.
</p>
<p>
“Only about six inches more around the waist
line,” grinned Billy, dodging a blow from the
fleshy youth’s fat but muscular arm.
</p>
<p>
Shouldering the supplies, which consisted of
such staples as bacon, flour, sugar, rice and so
forth, the lads made their way up the beach,
having first carried the dory’s anchor far up
above highwater mark. They took their way
along the electrically-charged fence till they came
to a spot where there was a gate and a switch
to break the connection. Frank turned off the
switch, grounded the current, and opened the
gate, through which they passed, and entered
on a narrow path winding up among the rocks.
When they had all gone through, Frank closed
the gate, snapped on the switch again and the
fence became as mischievous as before.
</p>
<p>
In single file, headed by Harry, for Frank had
now taken a rear place, they toiled up the steep
path until, at the summit of the rocky little cliff,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
it plunged into the woods. Traversing these
for a short distance, and always climbing upward,
for the island converged to a point in the
middle, they at length emerged on a clearing,
evidently of nature’s workmanship, for there
was no trace of recently felled trees or other
human work.
</p>
<p>
The floor of this clearing was of rock, and off
at one side a clear spring bubbled cheerfully over
into a barrel set so as to catch the overflow. In
the center of the open space stood a small but
substantially-built portable house—one of the
sectional kind. This formed the living quarters
of the young island dwellers. Above it rose, like
gaunt, leafless trees, two iron poles set thirty
feet apart and stayed by stout guy wires. Between
those two poles were suspended, by block
and tackle, the aërials, or antennæ, by which messages
were caught and sent. Within the hut was
the rest of the wireless apparatus, which, with
the exception of some improvements of Frank’s
devising, was of the portable kind—the same in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
fact that they had used in Florida. Outside the
hut was a small shelter covering a four horse-power
gasolene engine, which generated the
power for the station.
</p>
<p>
As most boys are familiar nowadays with the
rudiments of wireless telegraphy we are not going
into technical details concerning the plant.
Suffice it to say that the boys were able to converse
with Portland, under favorable conditions,
and judged that, in suitable weather, they had a
radius of some two hundred and fifty miles.
</p>
<p>
But it was off to one side of the clearing, the
side nearest to the cove, that the most interesting
structure on the island was situated. This
was more of a covering than a shed, for it consisted
merely of a roof supported with uprights;
but in bad weather canvas curtains could be
drawn so as to make its interior stormproof.
</p>
<p>
This shed was now open, and under the roof
could be seen what was perhaps at the moment
the most unique machine of its kind in the world.
Looking into that shed you would have said at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
first that it housed a boat. For the first object
that struck your eye was a double-ended, flat-bottomed
craft of shimmering aluminum metal,
about thirty feet in length and built on the general
lines of one of our life-saving craft. That
is to say, with “whalebacks” at each end containing
air chambers, and plenty of beam and
room within the cockpit. A peculiar feature,
however, was the addition of four wheels.
</p>
<p>
But the boat theory would have had to be
abandoned the next moment, for above the hull
of the whaleboat-shaped craft was what appeared
to be the understructure of an aëroplane. But
the planes—the broad wings—themselves were
lacking. The twin propellers connected to a motor
within the boat were, however, in place. Apparently
they were driven by chains, similar to,
but stouter than, the ordinary bicycle variety.
</p>
<p>
All about was a litter of tools and implements
of all kinds. Several large frames leaning
against one side of the shed appeared to be the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
skeleton forms of the wings which were soon to
be added to the superstructure.
</p>
<p>
“Tamales and terrapins!” cried Pudge admiringly,
as he gazed at the uncompleted craft, “but
she begins to look like something, eh, Frank?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” nodded the young aviator, “but until
your father arrives we cannot adjust the wings.
There is a lot of theoretical work connected with
them that he will have to do. By the way, I
wonder if Portland’s got any answer to our message
yet?”
</p>
<p>
Followed by the others, Frank entered the living hut,
which proved to be a snug, neat compartment
about fifteen feet in length, by ten in
width. It had four windows, two on a side, and
a door at one end. At the other end was the
wireless apparatus, with its glittering bright
metal parts, and businesslike-looking condensers
and tuning coils. Along the walls were four
bunks, two on a side, one above the other. In
the center were a table and camp chairs, and
from the ceiling hung a large oil lamp.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
</p>
<p>
A shelf held a good collection of books on aëro
and wireless subjects, and at one side of the door
was a blue-flame kerosene stove. On the other
side of the door was a cupboard containing
crockery, knives, forks and cooking utensils.
Altogether, if the boys had not been there for a
more serious purpose, the place might have been
said to form an almost ideal camp for four
healthy, active lads.
</p>
<p>
“Start up the motor, Harry,” said Frank, as
soon as they had deposited their burdens, “and
we’ll try and get some track of Dr. Perkins. His
answer to our message ought to be in Portland
by now.”
</p>
<p>
The younger Chester lad hastened outside, and
soon the popping of the motor announced that it
was running. Frank sat down at the key and,
depressing it, sent a blue-white flame crackling
across the spark gap. Out into space, from the
aërials stretched above, the message went volleying.
It was the call of the Portland station that
Frank was sending. He flashed it out three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
times, as is customary, and then signed it F-C.,
the latter being Brigg Island’s agreed-upon signature.
Then, while the others gathered round,
Frank adjusted the “phones,” the delicate receivers
that clamp over the ear and through which,
by way of the detector, any message vibrating in
the air may be caught as it encounters the antenna.
</p>
<p>
Frank listened some time but—save for the
conversation of two wireless operators far out
at sea—he could hear nothing. With a gesture of
impatience Frank began adjusting his tuning
coil. All at once he broke into a smile of satisfaction.
At last Portland was answering:
</p>
<p>
“F—C! F—C! F—C!”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” rejoined Frank, sending a volley
of sparks crashing and flashing across the gap as
soon as he could break in, “is there any answer
to my message?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Perkins will be at Motthaven to-morrow night.
He wants you to meet him,” came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
back the answer, winging its way over the intervening
miles of space.
</p>
<p>
“Is that all?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all.”
</p>
<p>
Frank removed the “phones,” grounded his
key and told Harry he could stop the motor.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be glad when the doctor does get here,”
he confided to the others, after he had communicated
the message, “for I’m beginning to think
that we are in for some sort of trouble. Those
two Daniels are pretty influential in the village,
and it only needs a word from them to turn the
whole crowd against us.”
</p>
<p>
“We could stand ’em off,” bragged Pudge
grandiloquently, “lassoes and lobsters, we could
stand ’em off. I half wish they would come—buttons
and buttercakes, but I do!” and Pudge
doubled up his fists and looked fierce.
</p>
<p>
“You forget, Pudge,” said Frank, “that we are
here in positions of responsibility. All this property
is your father’s. It is our duty to see that
no harm comes to it. A bunch of those fishermen inflamed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
by anger might be able to do more
harm here in an hour than could be repaired in
months, not to mention the cost.”
</p>
<p>
“Surely you don’t think they’d come down to
actual violence, Frank?” inquired Harry.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. The two Daniels looked mighty
savage to-day, I can tell you. If it hadn’t been
for the electric fence they might have made trouble.
At all events I’ll be glad to have some advice.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III.—A NIGHT ALARM.</h2>
<p>
After supper that night, a meal consisting of
fried salt pork, boiled potatoes and some fresh
fish which Frank had caught earlier in the day,
the elder of the Chester lads called what he
termed “a conference,” although Billy Barnes declared
it was more in the nature of a “council of
war.”
</p>
<p>
We are not going to detail here all that was
said as it would make wearisome reading; but,
after an hour or more of talk, Frank spoke his
mind.
</p>
<p>
“It may be all foolishness, of course,” he said,
“but I think that we ought not to leave the island
unguarded to-night. Daniels and his son
have had a taste of that wire fence and they
may have figured out some way to get around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
it—it would be a simple enough matter to do,
after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what’s your proposal?” inquired Billy
Barnes.
</p>
<p>
“To patrol the island all night, taking turns
on watch. It’s not more than a mile or so all
round it, and it ought to be an easy matter to
keep the ground thoroughly covered.”
</p>
<p>
“Rifles and rattlesnakes!” burst out Pudge,
“I thought this was to be a sort of working vacation
and not a civil war.”
</p>
<p>
Frank smiled, and then assumed a graver expression
as he went on:
</p>
<p>
“There is so much valuable property here
which it would be easy for malicious people to
injure that I wouldn’t feel justified in leaving
the island unguarded all night. What do the
rest of you think?”
</p>
<p>
“Just as you do, Frank,” rejoined Harry heartily,
while Billy and Pudge nodded vigorously;
“we’ve got to keep a sharp lookout. I nominate
myself and Pudge for the first watch—say from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
eight to twelve. You and Billy can go on duty
from midnight till daylight.”
</p>
<p>
After some discussion this order of procedure
was adopted. Promptly at eight o’clock Harry
and Pudge Perkins went “on duty,” while Frank
and Billy turned in to get what sleep they could.
As a matter of precaution, when they came to
the island, the boys had brought along a revolver,
and Harry was armed with this when he went
on duty. He was not, of course, to use it as a
weapon of offence, but it was agreed that, in
case there was any alarm during his watch, he
was to fire it three times, when the others would
come to his assistance.
</p>
<p>
Harry and Pudge accompanied each other as
far as the gate, and then threaded their way
down the path among the rocks toward the beach.
A mild current had been turned on in the fence,
enough to give an uncomfortable shock to any
one tampering with it, but not enough to exhaust
the storage batteries which supplied it.
</p>
<p>
When they reached the beach, Harry paused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’d better start this patrol in opposite directions,”
he said, “and then we can meet each
other once on every circuit.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed Pudge, “but—pirates and
parachutes—keep a good eye open.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry about me,” rejoined Harry; “so
long!”
</p>
<p>
As he spoke each boy stepped off into the darkness
to begin the patrol. As Harry trudged
along the beach his mind was full of the events
of which Frank had spoken that afternoon. Up
in the lighted hut, with his companions around
him, it had seemed a very remote possibility to
the boy that any attack should be made on the
island. But pacing along under the stars, with
only the sound of his own footsteps for company,
placed a very different light on the matter. What
if the disgruntled fishermen should make a night
descent on the island?
</p>
<p>
“This won’t do,” exclaimed Harry to himself,
coming to a sudden halt in the cove opposite to
which the motor boat was moored, and where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
a blacker patch on the dark sand showed him
the beached dinghy, “it’s no use getting shivery
and scared just because a couple of cranky fishermen
are so sore at us. I’ve got to brace up,
that’s all there is to it.”
</p>
<p>
His surroundings, however, were not calculated
to soothe the nervous suspense of the lad.
Except for the stars glittering like steel points
in the night sky there was no light. The night
was so pitchy dark, on the beach under the
shadow of the trees, that he could hardly see
with certainty a yard ahead of him. The surf
roared hoarsely against the rocks at the point—for
the tide was full, and the night wind moaned
in the trees like a note of warning.
</p>
<p>
With an idea of carrying out his patrol properly,
Harry went toward the darker patch amid
the gloom which showed him where the beached
dinghy lay. He examined it as well as he could,
and made sure that it was well above tide water.
Having completed this, he paced on, and in due
time heard footsteps approaching him which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
knew must be those of Pudge Perkins. A minute
later the two young sentinels met and exchanged
greetings. Pudge had nothing to report, except
that it was what he called a “creepy” job. However,
he pluckily averred: “Ghosts and gibberish,
Harry, I’m going to stick it out.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” approved Harry, and after a
few words both boys once more started out on
their lonesome tours of duty.
</p>
<p>
In due course Harry again reached the cove
opposite the schooner hulk, and this time, being
rather tired, he decided to sit down on the
beached dinghy and take a rest. But, to his astonishment,
it didn’t seem to be in the place
where it should have been.
</p>
<p>
“I could have sworn it was right here,” said
Harry to himself, as he trudged about on his
quest, “it must be close at hand. Guess I’ll fall
over it and hurt my shins in a minute.”
</p>
<p>
But although he reassured himself, the boy
felt far from secure in his belief. After a further
painstaking search he was fain to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
confess—what he really believed from the first—that the
dinghy which had lain there a short time before
had mysteriously vanished!
</p>
<p>
“Can it be those miserable Daniels?” gasped
Harry to himself. “Yes, it must be,” he went
on, answering his own questions, “who else would
have done it, unless it drifted off.”
</p>
<p>
He was moving about as he spoke, and as he
uttered the last words he stumbled across something
that showed him very plainly that the
dinghy could not have drifted away from the
beach. What he had fallen over was the anchor
firmly embedded in the sand, with a length of
rope still attached to it.
</p>
<p>
Harry felt along the bit of rope in the darkness
till he reached the end of it. Then he
struck a match. In the flicker of light which
followed he saw plainly enough what had occurred—the
rope had been slashed through. The
boy had just made this discovery when from the
water he heard something that caused him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
listen acutely, bending every sense to the operation.
</p>
<p>
What he had heard was the splash of an oar,
and a quick exclamation of impatience, as if the
rower, whoever he was, had blamed his involuntary
misstroke.
</p>
<p>
“Some one’s out there, and they’re aboard the
schooner, too; or I’m very much mistaken,” exclaimed
Harry to himself, as, listening acutely,
he caught the sound of footsteps proceeding,
seemingly, by their hollow ring, from the decks
of the dismantled hulk; “what will I do? If I
fire the pistol I’ll scare them off, and if I
don’t——”
</p>
<p>
He stopped short. A sudden daring idea had
flashed into his mind. The boy hastily slipped
off his shoes and divested himself of all but his
undergarments. Then, leaving his pistol on the
beach, he slipped noiselessly into the bay and
struck out in the direction of the schooner. The
water was bitterly cold, as it always is off the
Maine coast, even in the height of summer, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
Harry kept dauntlessly on, determined to brave
anything in the execution of his purpose.
</p>
<p>
The hulk lay only about a hundred yards off
the shore, and before long he could see her dark
outlines looming up against the lighter darkness
of the sky on the horizon. He fancied, but could
not be certain that it was not an illusion, that
for an instant he could see two forms creeping
along the decks. The next moment something
showed up ahead of him with which he almost
collided.
</p>
<p>
Harry, with a gasp of gratitude, for the water
had chilled him to the bone, recognized it as the
motor boat. As silently as he could he drew
himself up into it, and then, casting himself flat
in the cockpit, he listened with all his might for
further sounds from the schooner.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV.—CUT ADRIFT.</h2>
<p>
He did not have long to wait. Seemingly, whoever
the marauders were—and as to their identity
the lad could hazard a pretty good guess—they
did not bother much about lowering their
voices.
</p>
<p>
“By the jumping crickey!” he heard coming
over the water from the schooner, “jiggered if I
kin make out what they cal’kelated ter use this
hulk fer.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush! Not so loud, pop. Ther sound carries
tur’rble fur over ther water.”
</p>
<p>
“As if I didn’t know thet, Zeb, but what do
we care? Them kids is fast asleep, and anyhow,
we cut the dinghy adrift so they couldn’t do us
any harm ef they wanted to.”
</p>
<p>
“Thet’s right, too; but some of ’em might be
prowling about. They’re up ter all sorts uv
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
tricks. I ain’t forgot thet thar fence, I kin tell
yer. My arm’s a-tingling yet whar thet electricity
hit me.”
</p>
<p>
Soaked through as he was, and chilly into the
bargain, Harry couldn’t help smiling as he heard
this eloquent testimonial to the efficacy of the
“charged” fence. He had caught the name of
“Zeb,” too, which speedily removed all doubt
from his mind as to the identity of the marauders.
</p>
<p>
“The precious rascals,” he thought, while his
teeth chattered with cold, “I’m mighty glad I
did swim out here, even if I am almost frozen
to death. If they aren’t under arrest to-morrow
it won’t be my fault.”
</p>
<p>
Little more was heard from the schooner, but
from what he could catch he surmised that the
two fishers were completely mystified by the
craft. Presently he heard their footsteps descending
the gangway and then came the splash
of oars. They were dipped silently no longer, a
pretty sure sign that the two rascals didn’t much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
care if they were heard or not. After a moment
the splashing sound grew more remote, and
Harry knew that the two prowlers had taken
their departure.
</p>
<p>
There was a scull in the motor boat and as
soon as he was sure that the Daniels were out
of earshot, Harry up anchored and began sculling
the motor boat toward the hulk. The distance
was so short that he did not want to bother
to start the engine, and in a few seconds he was
alongside the dark hulk. He shoved along the
side till the motor boat grated against the gangway,
and then, not forgetting to make the motor
craft fast, he leaped up the steps, with the purpose
of discovering what harm, if any, had been
wrought aboard the <em>Betsy Jane</em>.
</p>
<p>
Harry knew where a lantern was kept, and
descending into what had once been the cabin he
began rummaging about for it. In the pitchy
blackness the task took him longer than he had
anticipated, but at last he found the lantern and
the matches which lay beside it. Hastily striking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
a light he soon had the bare cabin filled with the
yellow rays of the lamp. As has been explained,
the <em>Betsy Jane</em> had been purchased as a sort of
“trying-out” appliance for the inventions of Dr.
Perkins, and therefore the cabin contained nothing
in the way of furniture. The lamp, in fact,
had only been placed on board as a precaution
in case a riding light was ever needed on the anchored
hulk. But as she had remained at her
moorings in the isolated cove this was not, of
course, necessary.
</p>
<p>
A brief look about the cabin showed Harry
that nothing had been molested there. In fact,
as has been said, there was nothing to molest. A
door in the forward bulkhead led into the empty
hold, and the boy next made his way there, the
lamp casting weird shadows on the timbers as
he went. His steps rang hollowly through the
deserted ship, and he could hardly repress a shudder
as he threaded his way among the stanchions,
which, like the pillars in a church, upheld the
deck above his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
Reaching what had been the forecastle of the
<em>Betsy Jane</em>, Harry came to the conclusion that
nothing had been damaged below. His next task
was to go up on deck. His examination below
decks had been painstaking, and had occupied
him some time, but he was determined to make it
a thorough one. The fact is that an ugly suspicion
had crept into Harry’s mind as he lay in
the bottom of the motor boat listening to the two
Daniels on board the schooner. This was nothing
more nor less than a dread that they might
have “scuttled” the craft. From what he knew
of them the two were capable of anything, and
he thought that in their rage at finding nothing
on board that they could damage they might have
bored holes in the schooner in order to sink her.
His investigation of the hold, however, had
shown him—to his great relief—that nothing
of the sort had occurred.
</p>
<p>
Coming on deck Harry made as careful a
search for damage as he had done in the hold.
But the inclined superstructure remained intact,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
and nothing indicated that the Daniels had done
anything more than stroll about, trying to discover
what the object of the schooner was.
</p>
<p>
So intent had Harry been on his task that he
had, for the time being, completely forgotten
that Pudge must be anxiously looking for him.
Going into the eyes of the craft he sent a hearty
hail ashore:
</p>
<p>
“Pudge ahoy! Oh-h-h-h, Pu-d-g-e!”
</p>
<p>
Then he stopped to listen intently. But no reply
came to his hail. He tried it again and again,
without success. Then he determined as a last
resort to fire the agreed-upon three shots. He
did not want to alarm his companions unnecessarily,
but surely, he thought, it would be a good
idea to arouse them and communicate what had
occurred since he left the hut.
</p>
<p>
Up to that moment the boy had completely forgotten
that he had left the pistol on the beach.
He felt compelled to laugh at himself for his
absentmindedness, but while the laugh was still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
on his lips something happened that caused it to
freeze there.
</p>
<p>
A mass of cold spray was suddenly projected
over the bow. At the same instant the old hulk
quivered at the smart “slap” of a wave.
</p>
<p>
“Gracious!” thought Harry to himself, “the
sea must be getting up. I reckon I’d best be
going back ashore.”
</p>
<p>
As he made his way aft toward the gangway
he found that the sea must indeed have risen
since he came on board. The old hulk was rolling
about like a bottle, and he had to hold on to
the rail as he made his way along the decks. Getting
into the motor boat under these conditions
was no easy task. But it was accomplished at
last.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I’ll start the engine before I cut
adrift,” said Harry to himself.
</p>
<p>
Later on he was to be very thankful he did.
Turning on the switch and gasolene he began
to “spin” the fly wheel; but beyond a wheezy
cough the motor gave no sign of responding.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
For more than half an hour the boy worked with
might and main over the refractory bit of machinery,
but to no effect. The engine was absolutely
“dead.”
</p>
<p>
“What can be the matter with it?” thought
Harry to himself. “It’s never acted this way before.”
</p>
<p>
He stood up, too engrossed in his problem to
realize what a sea was running. Before he could
recover his balance the pitching craft almost
bucked him overboard.
</p>
<p>
“Gracious! the waves are getting up with a
vengeance,” exclaimed the boy to himself; “I can
never scull ashore in this sea. Queer, too, there,
doesn’t seem to be any more wind than when I
left shore. Certainly I’ve never seen the sea as
rough as this in the inlet before.”
</p>
<p>
With the object of finding out what ailed the
obstinate motor, he returned to the deck of the
schooner where he had left the lamp. Getting
into the motor boat with it once more, by dint of
much balancing and holding on he cast its rays
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
on the single cylinder. Almost simultaneously
he saw what had happened. Somebody, he had
no difficulty in guessing who, had removed the
sparking points. No wonder that no explosion
had followed his efforts to get the craft under
way.
</p>
<p>
“Well, here’s a fine fix,” thought Harry; “even
if I could attract their attention ashore I’ve got
no means of getting there. Oh, if I won’t get
even with those Daniels as soon as I get a chance!
Wonder what I’d better do?”
</p>
<p>
His first move was to clamber back on board
the schooner, for the wild rolling of the motor
boat, as she plunged about at the foot of the gangway,
was not helpful to thought. Gaining the
deck once more Harry sought out the cabin and
seated himself on the edge of one of the empty
bunks which ranged its sides.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly it occurred to him that he was uncommonly
sleepy, and at the same time he
thought that possibly it would be a good idea
to pass the rest of the night in slumber. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
no watch, but he imagined that it could not be
so very far to daylight. With this object in
view he cast himself down in the bunk and, despite
the hardness of the bed and the chilliness
of his scantily clad limbs, he rapidly slipped away
from his surroundings into a dreamless sleep.
</p>
<p>
When he awoke the sun was shining through
the stern ports. That is, it was for one instant,
and then in the next it was obscured again.
Harry was enough of a sailor to know that this
meant a cloudy day, with possibly a piping wind
scurrying the clouds across the sky.
</p>
<p>
“Thank goodness it’s daylight anyhow!” he exclaimed,
jumping from his uncomfortable couch,
with an ache in every limb in his body; “now
to go on deck and attract their attention ashore.”
</p>
<p>
Utterly unprepared for the shock that was to
greet him, Harry bounded up the companionway
stairs and on to the deck.
</p>
<p>
Had a bomb exploded at his feet he could not
have been more thunderstruck than he was at
the sight which greeted him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
</p>
<p>
There was no island, no distant mainland.
Nothing but miles upon miles of tumbling blue
water in which the <em>Betsy Jane</em> was wallowing
about, casting showers of spray over her bow
every time she nosed into a billow.
</p>
<p>
Harry’s heart stood still for an instant. His
senses swam dizzily. Then, with a sudden return
of his faculties, he realized what had occurred.
</p>
<p>
The mooring rope of the <em>Betsy Jane</em> had been
cut or had broken, and he was miles out on the
Atlantic without a prospect of succor.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V.—ADVENTURES ON THE HULK.</h2>
<p>
A sudden sharp puff of wind, followed by a
heavier dip than usual on the part of the dismantled
hulk, apprised the boy that both breeze
and sea were increasing. Putting aside, for the
moment, by a brave effort, his heart sickness,
Harry ran to the rail and peered over the side.
The motor boat was careering gallantly along by
the side of her big consort, and the boy was glad
to note that the painter still held, despite the
strain.
</p>
<p>
But Harry knew, from his examination the
previous night, that it would be useless to try
to escape by the motor craft. She was disabled
beyond hope of repair, unless he could get another
spark plug. Having made sure the motor
craft was all right, Harry returned to the bow
and sat down to think the situation over.
</p>
<p>
It would have been a trying one for a man to
face, let alone a lad; but Harry’s numerous adventures
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
had given him a power of calm thought
beyond his years, and he managed to marshal
his ideas into some sort of shape as he crouched
under the bow bulwarks.
</p>
<p>
“Evidently the <em>Betsy Jane</em> was caught by the
tide, when it turned, and carried out to sea,” he
thought, “and then, when the wind got up, she
drifted still faster. I wonder if her mooring
rope broke or if it was cut—guess I’ll take a
look.”
</p>
<p>
The boy dragged inboard the end of the mooring
line that still hung over the bow. One look
at it was enough. The clean cut strands showed
conclusively that it had been severed, just above
the water line, by a sharp knife. The fact that
the Daniels could not know that any one would
come on board after they slashed the line did not
make their act any less heinous in Harry’s eyes.
It had been their deliberate intention to set the
schooner adrift, and they had succeeded only too
well in their act of spite.
</p>
<p>
“Whatever will they be thinking on the island
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
when they discover all this?” thought Harry with
a low groan. “They’ll imagine that I’m dead, or
at least that some fatal accident has befallen me,
and, worst of all, they have no boat to use to
reach the mainland. They are just as much prisoners
as I am.”
</p>
<p>
Sharp pangs of hunger now began to assail
the lad, and he recollected, with a thankful heart,
that on board the motor boat there were the remains
of a lunch they had taken ashore with
them on their expedition the previous day. There
was also a keg of water. Harry lost no time
in descending the gangway and making his way
to the locker where the food had been stored.
First, however, he made a foray on the water
keg. Taking out the stopper he found that it
was only half full, but he slaked his thirst gratefully,
taking care to use as small a quantity of
the fluid as possible. He knew that before long
the water might be precious indeed.
</p>
<p>
In the locker he found the remnants of the
lunch. As he consumed the scraps of bread and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
cheese, and a small hunk of corned beef, he recalled
with what light hearts they had fallen to
the meal of which he was now devouring the remains.
The recollection almost overcame him.
With a strong effort the boy choked back a sob
and formed a grim determination not to dwell
upon his miserable situation more than was possible.
He felt that the main thing was to keep
a clear head.
</p>
<p>
There was some spare rope on board the hulk,
and with this Harry made the fastenings of the
launch more secure, leading one end of the rope
on board the schooner itself, and making it fast
to a cleat. He felt that the craft would be more
safe if attached thus than would have been the
case had he depended on the gangway alone.
</p>
<p>
This done, he took a look about him. He had
had a vague hope that he might sight a ship of
some sort, but the ocean was empty as a desert.
Not a sail or a smudge of smoke marred the
horizon. All this time the wind had been steadily
freshening, and Harry judged that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
schooner must be drifting before it quite fast.
The inclined superstructure naturally added to
her “windage” and made her go before the gale
more rapidly. The sea, too, was piling up in
great, glistening, green water rows, which looked
formidable indeed. But so far the <em>Betsy Jane</em>
had wallowed along right gallantly, only shipping
a shower of spray occasionally when a big
sea struck her obliquely on the bow.
</p>
<p>
“If only I had plenty of food and water,”
thought Harry, “this would be nothing more than
a good bit of adventure, but——”
</p>
<p>
In accordance with his resolution not to dwell
on the more serious aspects of his predicament
he dismissed this side of the case from his mind.
But as the day wore on, and he grew intolerably
thirsty, the thought of what might be his fate,
if he did not fall in with some vessel, beset his
mind more and more, to the exclusion of all else.
In the afternoon, as closely as he could judge
the time, he took another drink from the fast-diminishing
supply in the keg. He noticed, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
an unpleasant shock, that the fluid was growing
alarmingly lower. Before he took the draught
he had cleaned up the remaining crumbs left in
the locker, and was now absolutely without food.
</p>
<p>
The rest of that afternoon he passed watching
the empty sea for some sign of a ship, but not
a trace of one could he discover. Utterly disheartened
he watched the sun set in a blaze of
crimson and gold. The sunset lay behind him,
and Harry knew by this that he was drifting east
at a rapid rate. Just how rapid he had, of course,
no means of calculating. Of one thing he was
thankful—the sea had not increased, and the
wind appeared to have fallen considerably with
the departure of daylight.
</p>
<p>
“Surely,” thought the boy, “I must have
drifted on the track of ocean vessels by this time.
I know there’s a line to Halifax, and another to
Portland, besides the coasters.”
</p>
<p>
With this thought came another. What if he
should be run down during the night? The idea
sent a shudder through his scantily clothed form.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
He knew that derelicts are often the cause of
marine disasters, and during the dark hours
the hulk might invite such a fate if he did not
take steps to guard against it.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly he lit his lantern and hung it in
the underpinning of the inclined superstructure.
</p>
<p>
“At least they can see that,” he thought, as he
completed the hanging of his warning light.
</p>
<p>
Then, having done all he well could under the
circumstances, Harry cast himself down in the
lee of the weather bulwarks and tried to sleep.
But in his scanty attire he was far too cold to
do aught but lie and shiver till his teeth chattered.
He determined to pass the rest of the
night below, and once more sought a couch in
the empty bunk. But sleep was a long time coming.
Tired, excited and hungry as the boy was,
he could not compose himself to slumber. Ten
or a dozen times he started up and ran to the
deck, thinking that he had heard the distant beat
of some vessel’s engines. But each time it proved
a false alarm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
At length tired nature asserted herself, and
he sank to sleep in good earnest. When he
awakened it was daylight, and there was an odd
feeling about the motion of the <em>Betsy Jane</em>. She
seemed to have ceased her rolling and pitching,
and was almost steady in the water. Suddenly
there came a jarring crash that almost threw
Harry out of the bunk.
</p>
<p>
Much startled, he ran on deck, and found, to
his astonishment, that the vessel lay right off an
island. Seemingly she had grounded on a reef
of rocks stretching out from the island itself.
At any rate, as the waves rocked her she gave
a jarring, crunching bump with each pitch of her
hull. The island appeared to be a small one,
and in general appearance was not unlike Brig
Island. In fact, at first Harry had thought that
in some magical way the <em>Betsy Jane</em> had drifted
back to that small speck of land. But a second
glance showed him that the island off which the
dismantled hull had grounded differed in many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
essentials from the one he had left. Far to the
westward, about twenty miles as well as the boy
could judge, lay a dim streak of dark blue that
Harry guessed was the mainland. But for all
the good it did him it might have been a hundred
miles removed.
</p>
<p>
Harry was still gazing at the island and wondering
how he could reach it before the <em>Betsy
Jane</em> pounded herself to pieces on the rocks, when
he started violently. The island was not, as he
had supposed, uninhabited—at least, he had
caught sight of a swirl of blue smoke rising from
among the trees on its highest part. This meant
help, companionship and food. An involuntary
cry of joy rose to the boy’s lips, which the next
instant turned to a groan as he looked over the
side of the schooner and saw that the reef on
which she had struck was much too far out from
the shore for him to try to swim the distance,
even if a roaring, racing tide would not have
made it suicidal to attempt the feat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
“Unless I can attract the attention of whoever
lives there by shouting, I’m as badly off as I was
before,” exclaimed Harry, in a voice made quavery

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI.—HARRY MEETS AN OLD FRIEND.</h2>
<p>
All at once, while he was still gazing at the
column of smoke shoreward, Harry became
aware of a figure coming out of the woods toward
the beach. He shouted with all his might,
and the man who had appeared from the undergrowth
waved a reply.
</p>
<p>
Then his voice came over the water.
</p>
<p>
“What’s up?”
</p>
<p>
The tone somehow was strangely familiar to
Harry, and, for that matter, when he had first
seen the figure of the newcomer it had struck
him with an odd sense of familiarity. Suddenly
he realized why this was.
</p>
<p>
“Ben Stubbs!” he yelled at the top of his lungs.
</p>
<p>
“Ahoy, mate!” came back after a pause; “who
are you?”
</p>
<p>
“Harry Chester!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
“By the great horn spoon! What the dickens
are you doing out there?”
</p>
<p>
Cupping his hands to make his voice carry
the better, Harry hailed back once more.
</p>
<p>
“I drifted here on this hulk. Can you take
me off?”
</p>
<p>
“Can I? Wait a jiffy.”
</p>
<p>
Ben Stubbs—for it was actually the “maroon”
whom the boys had rescued from a miserable fate
in the Nicaraguan treasure valley—began running
along the shore as fast as his short legs
would carry him. Presently he vanished around
a wooded promontory, leaving Harry in a strange
jumble of feelings. What could the good-hearted
old companion of several of their adventures be
doing on this desolate island off the Maine coast?
When they had last heard from him he had been
running a tug boat line in New York harbor, having
purchased the business with the profits made
out of the discovery of the treasure trove in the
Sargasso Sea.
</p>
<p>
Before a great while the man who had so opportunely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
appeared came into view once more
This time he was in a skiff, rowing with strong
strokes toward the stranded hulk of the <em>Betsy
Jane</em>. Harry watched him with eager eyes. Fast
as Ben Stubbs rowed, it seemed an eternity to the
anxious boy before his strangely rediscovered
friend reached the side of the grounded schooner.
</p>
<p>
When he did so he hastily made fast, and was
up the gangway ladder three steps at a time.
Fortunately for his haste, the sea had diminished
in roughness considerably, and the <em>Betsy Jane</em>
lay almost motionless on the reef. Otherwise he
would have stood a strong chance of being
thrown from his footing. Harry was at the
gangway as Ben Stubbs’ weather-beaten countenance
came into view at the top of the steps.
</p>
<p>
Ben seized the boy’s hand in a grip that made
Harry flinch, but he returned it with as strong
a clench as he could. For a moment both of
them were too much overcome with emotion at
the strange meeting to utter a word. It was Ben
who spoke first.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
“Waal, what under the revolving universe
are you doing here?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“I was about to ask the same question of you.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a long story, boy, and you look just about
played out. What has happened? I never
dreamed that you were even in this neighborhood.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess the same thing applies to me, so far
as you are concerned, Ben,” rejoined Harry, between
a laugh and a sob. “As for myself, I’ve
been adrift all night on this old hulk. Some rascals
cut her loose from her moorings at Brig
Island.”
</p>
<p>
“Wow! you’ve drifted all the way from there.
Why, it’s fifty miles or more away.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it. It seemed a million to me. What
worries me is what the others must be thinking.
They won’t know if I’m dead or alive.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll find a way to let ’em know, never fear,”
struck in Ben in his deep, rumbling voice; “but
I reckon you’re hungry and thirsty?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
“Am I? Why, I could eat a horse without
sauce or salt, as you used to say.”
</p>
<p>
“Then get in the skiff and come ashore. I’ve
got a sort of a hut there. It ain’t much of a
place, but I’ve got enough to eat and a good
spring of clear water, and I can give you a
suit of slops.”
</p>
<p>
“But the schooner?” demanded Harry.
</p>
<p>
“She’ll be all right, I reckon. She’s lying on
a sort of sandy ridge that runs out here. The
sea’s gone down so that she won’t do herself any
harm, and we can’t do her any good right now.
You see, the tide is falling. When it rises we’ll
try to get her off and anchor her in a snugger
berth.”
</p>
<p>
Harry might have argued the point, but the
prospect of food and drink made so strong an
appeal to him that he did not stop to waste words.
Five minutes later they were rowing ashore, and,
while Ben bent to the oars with a will, Harry
told him in detail all that happened since they
came to Brig Island, and the reason of their presence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
there. He knew that he was safe in confiding
in old Ben.
</p>
<p>
The relation of his story occupied the entire
trip to the shore, and when Ben had beached his
skiff he seized Harry by the arm and began hurrying
him up the beach toward a small hut, half
canvas, half lumber, which stood back under the
shelter of a low bluff. The boy was desperately
anxious to learn the reason of Ben’s presence on
the island, for he knew it could have no ordinary
cause. But the weather-beaten old adventurer
would not allow the boy to say another word
till he had clothed himself and eaten all he could
put away of a rabbit stew washed down with
strong coffee.
</p>
<p>
“Now, then,” remarked Ben, as soon as Harry
had finished, “I suppose you’re a-dyin’ to hear
what I’m doin’ on Barren Island, which is the
name of this bit of land?”
</p>
<p>
“I am, indeed,” declared Harry, shoving back
the cracker box which had served him as a chair;
“the last person in the world I would have expected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
to see when the <em>Betsy Jane</em> grounded was
Ben Stubbs.”
</p>
<p>
Ben chuckled.
</p>
<p>
“Allers turnin’ up, like a bad penny, ain’t I?”
he said, shoving some very black tobacco into his
old pipe. “’Member ther time I dropped out of
the sky in thet dirigible balloon?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I should say I did,” laughed Harry;
“but how you got here is past my comprehension.
What became of the tug boat line?”
</p>
<p>
Ben snapped his fingers.
</p>
<p>
“All gone, my lad! Gone just like that! I
reckon I’m not a good hand at business, or the
crooked tricks that answers for that same. Anyhow,
to make a long yarn a short one, I went
on a friend’s note and he dug out. That was
blow number one. To meet that note I had to
mortgage some of my boats, and in some way—blow
me if I rightly understand it yet—I got
myself in a hole whar’ the lawyer fellers bled
me till I was mighty near dry. I tried to struggle
along, but it wasn’t no go. Then came a strike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
of tug boat hands and that finished me. I
couldn’t stand the long lay off without anything
to do, so I sold out for what I could get, and—and
here I am.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m mighty sorry to hear that you failed,
Ben,” said Harry with real sympathy in his tones,
“but you haven’t said yet what you are doing
here on Barren Island, as you call it.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m a-gettin’ to that, lad,” said Ben, emitting
a cloud of blue smoke; “give me time. As I told
you, that feller on whose note I went, skedaddled.
You see, I’d trusted him as my own brother,
bein’ as I knew his father when I was a miner.
He—that’s this chap’s father, I mean—was a
Frenchman, Raoul Duval was his name, and his
son’s name the same. Old man Duval made his
pile in Lower Californy and was makin’ fer his
home in New Orleans when ther steamer he was
travelin’ on blew up, and he and all his gold dust—a
whalin’ big lot of it—went to the bottom.
</p>
<p>
“I never calculated to hear anything more of
Duval arter this, but one day this young feller
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
I’ve been tellin’ you about shows up in New York
and hunts me up. He tells me that he’s old
Raoul’s son, and that he’d had a run of hard
luck and so on, and wants to go into business,
and if, for his father’s sake, I’ll help him out.
I asks him how he found me out, and he says
that in his father’s letters home I had often been
mentioned, and that when he heard of the Stubbs
Towing Line he made inquiries and found that
I was in all probability the same man.
</p>
<p>
“As I told you, I let him have the money. It
don’t matter just how much, but it was quite a
bit. You see, I did it for the old man’s sake.
I was sorry afterward. Young Duval wasn’t a
chip of the old block at all. He was idle and
dissipated. His business went under and he
skipped out.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you lend him this money without security
of any sort?” asked Harry incredulously.
</p>
<p>
“In a way, yes. In another way, no. The
young chap, when he came to me, had a wild
story about knowing where the steamer on which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
his dad lost his life had sunk. He said that from
letters written home before he left Lower Californy,
he knew the old man was carrying with
him, besides the dust, a fortune in black pearls.
Of course, all these went down when the steamer
blew up. He had tried, he said, to get a lot of
folks interested in a scheme to get at the
wreck and recover the dust and the pearls, but
they had all laughed at him. He said if I’d give
him the money he wanted he’d give me, in return,
the plan of the location whar’ the steamer went
down.”
</p>
<p>
“And did he?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but since he acted as he did I guess
there’s no more truth in his yarn than there was
in anything else he told me. Anyhow, I’ve never
bothered my head about the matter since.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you got the plan?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure enough,” Ben fumbled in his pocket,
“here it is; it’s a roughly drawn thing, as you
see, but I reckon if the ship was really there it
would be an easy matter to locate her bones.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
Harry nodded. He was looking over the map
with deep attention. It was, as Ben had said, a
crudely drawn affair, and purported to have been
sketched by one of the survivors of the wreck,
who, of course, did not know that in the returning
miner’s cabin there was so much wealth.
</p>
<p>
“How did young Duval get hold of this?” he
asked at last.
</p>
<p>
“He said that by chance he met a man who
was the lone survivor of the disaster. This feller
didn’t know who Duval was, and began talking
to him about the wreck. Duval, recollecting that
his father had carried a sum that amounted to
more than $75,000, was naturally interested. He
asked the man if he could draw him a sketch of
the scene where the steamer sank. The feller
said he could, and that thar sketch is what he
drawed. At least that’s Duval’s story, and I’m
frank to tell you I don’t believe a word of it.”
</p>
<p>
“But still you haven’t told me what you are
doing on this island,” said Harry after an interval.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s so, too, lad. I got so interested in
tellin’ my troubles I clean forgot about Barren
Island. Well, it’s this way. Arter the crash I
felt ashamed to show my face. Oh, all the creditors
were paid up—every last one of ’em. But
I felt like I was an old failure, and good fer
nuthin’, so I remembered all of a sudden about
this island that I’d been stranded on a good
many years ago. I made inquiries and found
that I could live here rent free as long as I liked,
with none to interfere, and so I came here. It’s
quiet and might be lonesome to some folks, but
it suits me well enough, and I was calculatin’
to spend the rest of my days here, till you came
along. But I feel different now.”
</p>
<p>
“How’s that?” asked Harry, not knowing well
just what to say to the old man who took his
business failure so much to heart.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I was watching you studyin’ that map.
I could see by yer face that you put some stock
in Duval’s yarn. Ain’t that so?”
</p>
<p>
Harry could not but confess that it was. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
old man’s story, and the map, had aroused in
him the strong desire for adventure that both
Boy Aviators possessed to a marked degree. Of
course, from what Ben had said, Duval did not
appear to be a person on whom much reliance
could be placed, but then, again, there was the
map, and it at least, even if crude, appeared to
have been a genuine effort to mark the spot
where the wreck lay. It showed a bayou marked
“Black Bayou,” running back from the main
stream of the Mississippi. A black dot some distance
up this bayou was lettered “Belle of New
Orleans,” presumably the name of the steamer
on which Duval met his end.
</p>
<p>
The boy was still pondering over the map
when, from seaward, there came a sound that
made both Harry Chester and Ben Stubbs spring
to their feet.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a gun!” shouted the old man, as the booming
echoes died away; “may be a ship in distress.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hardly, in this weather,” rejoined Harry, in
a perplexed tone.
</p>
<p>
But Ben Stubbs had darted from the shanty
and was running for the beached skiff. A minute
later Harry was close on his heels, and presently
they were pulling around the point, about
to run into the surprise of their lives.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII.—A PUZZLING PROBLEM.</h2>
<p>
It is now time that we returned to the island
where we left Pudge Perkins patrolling the
beach, and Frank Chester and Billy Barnes
wrapped in slumber. Frank had set the alarm
clock for midnight, when it had been arranged
that he and Billy were to turn out on patrol, and
its insistent clamor had only just commenced
when he sprang out of his bunk broad awake and
prepared to go on duty. Billy stretched and
yawned a bit before he, too, tumbled out.
</p>
<p>
“Gee whillakers!” he exclaimed, as he got into
his clothes, “it seems to me that we are making
a lot of fuss over nothing, Frank. I don’t believe
those fellows will come near the island to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps not; but it’s our duty to be on guard.
If anything happened to Dr. Perkins’ invention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
now it would be almost impossible to repair it in
time for the tests he wants to make.”
</p>
<p>
Talking thus the two lads got into their
clothes, drank some coffee, which Frank had prepared
while they were dressing, and then set out
into the night. They made for the cove from
which Harry had started his eventful swim.
</p>
<p>
“Best wait here till they come round,” said
Frank, and he and Billy found places in the sand
and made themselves as comfortable as possible
till they should hear the footsteps of one of the
young sentries. They had not long to wait.
Hardly fifteen minutes had elapsed before
Frank’s sharp ears caught the sound of some one
approaching. A minute later Pudge joined them.
His first words were not calculated to make the
newcomers feel at ease.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Harry?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know?” ejaculated Frank with considerable
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“No. I’ve been making my patrol regularly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
and the last three times I’ve been round I haven’t
met him.”
</p>
<p>
Frank’s face could only be dimly seen in the
darkness, but all his alarm was plain enough in
his next words.
</p>
<p>
“What can have become of him?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe he took the dinghy and decided to look
over the motor boat and the hulk,” suggested
Billy.
</p>
<p>
“That’s easy enough to find out,” declared
Frank, starting for the place where the dinghy
had been beached. A moment later he stumbled
over the anchor and, closely following this, by
the aid of a lighted match, he made the discovery
that the rope had been slashed.
</p>
<p>
“Harry never took that dinghy,” he exclaimed
apprehensively, “there’s been some crooked work
here.”
</p>
<p>
“Thunder and turtles! What do you mean?”
gasped Pudge, fully as anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“That some one has landed here and stolen
the dinghy and taken Harry along with them. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
can’t think of any other explanation. Harry
would never have cut that rope.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean he’s been carried off?” The question
came from Billy Barnes.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t think of any other explanation.
Pudge, did you hear anything that sounded
suspicious?”
</p>
<p>
“Oilskins and onions, no! Not a sound. Let’s
fire a pistol and see if we get any answer.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a good idea, Pudge—Great Scott!”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” demanded Billy Barnes,
as Frank broke off short and uttered the above
exclamation.
</p>
<p>
“Look here! Harry’s clothes! Wait till I get
a light. There! Now, see all his outer garments
and his pistol lying by them.”
</p>
<p>
“Gatling guns and grass hoppers, if this
doesn’t beat all.”
</p>
<p>
“He can’t have been carried off, then,” burst
out Billy, “but if he wasn’t, how did that dinghy
rope come to be cut?”
</p>
<p>
Frank made no answer at the moment. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
discovery of Harry’s clothes on the beach had
put a dreadful fear into his mind. What if the
boy had heard a disturbance on the hulk or on
the motor boat and, having swum off to see what
was the trouble, had been seized with a cramp
and drowned?
</p>
<p>
But Frank firmly thrust the question from him
the next minute. Such thoughts were by far too
unnerving to be dwelt on. The others remained
silent. They seemed to be waiting for Frank to
speak. Presently the words came.
</p>
<p>
“It’s too dark to see anything out there,” said
the boy, in as firm a voice as he could command.
“Let’s fire three shots—the signal we agreed
upon—and then if Harry is on the hulk or the
motor boat he will be sure to answer them.”
</p>
<p>
The others agreed that this seemed about the
best thing to do, and Pudge, taking Harry’s discarded
weapon, fired it three times. Then came
a long pause, filled with an ominous silence.
</p>
<p>
“Try again,” said Frank in a strained voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
Once more three sharp reports sounded. But
again there was no answer.
</p>
<p>
“That settles it,” declared Frank solemnly;
“something has happened to Harry. We must
get out to the hulk and to the motor boat.”
</p>
<p>
“How? The dinghy’s gone, and——”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to swim for it.”
</p>
<p>
Already Frank had thrown off his outer garments.
On the beach lay a balk of timber which
they sometimes used to tie the dinghy to. Frank
now ordered his companions to help in rolling
this down to the water.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to use it as a help in swimming out
there,” he said; “the water’s pretty cold, and I
don’t want to risk a cramp.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait till daylight, Frank,” urged Billy; “it
won’t be long till dawn now, and——”
</p>
<p>
But Frank cut him short abruptly.
</p>
<p>
“My brother’s out there somewhere,” he said
in a sharp, decisive voice, “and I’m going to find
out what’s happened to him.”
</p>
<p>
A minute later Frank was in the water pushing the balk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
of timber before him and heading,
as nearly as he knew how, for the spot
where the hulk and the motor boat had been
moored.
</p>
<p>
It was more than half an hour before Billy
and Pudge saw him again. Then he reappeared,
chilled through and shivering in every limb. His
first words almost deprived his companions of
breath.
</p>
<p>
“They’re gone!” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“What!” the exclamation came from both
Billy and Pudge simultaneously. They guessed
by some sort of intuition what Frank referred to.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, they’re both gone,” repeated Frank;
“the <em>Betsy Jane</em> and the motor boat.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure you’re not mistaken, Frank?”
inquired Billy, unwilling to believe the extent
of the catastrophe that had overtaken them.
</p>
<p>
“I’m as sure that they’re gone as I am that I
am standing here,” was the reply. “I cruised
about on my log for quite a radius, and couldn’t
discover a sign of them. I found the motor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
boat’s buoy, though. She had been untied by
some one.”
</p>
<p>
“But the <em>Betsy Jane</em>? Schooners and succotash!
The <em>Betsy Jane</em>!” broke in Pudge.
</p>
<p>
“Gone, too,” Frank’s voice broke, “but I
wouldn’t care about either if I only knew what
had become of Harry.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on up to the hut and we’ll have some
hot coffee and talk it over,” said Billy, who saw
that Frank, besides being almost numb with cold,
was half crazy at the mystery of Harry’s fate.
</p>
<p>
Frank suffered himself to be led up to the
hut and the rest of the night was passed in speculation
as to the fate of the missing boy. All
three of the lads were pretty sure that the two
Daniels had had a hand in the night’s work somehow,
but they were far from guessing what had
actually occurred.
</p>
<p>
Soon after daylight the wireless began working.
Dr. Perkins notified them from Portland
that he expected to arrive that afternoon at
Motthaven, and wished them to meet him. Frank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
found some relief for his wrought-up feelings
in informing the inventor of what had occurred.
</p>
<p>
“Will charter fast boat and be there with all
speed,” came the reply through the air; “make
the best of it till I come. Am confident that everything
will come out all right.”
</p>
<p>
And with this message the “marooned” trio on
the island had to be content. The day was passed
in making a careful survey of the island to discover,
if possible, some trace of the marauders.
But none was to be found. The tide had even
obliterated any footmarks they might have left
in the damp sand. Thoroughly disheartened and
miserable, the boys ate a scanty lunch and then
sat down to await the arrival of Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
It was sundown when a fast motor boat appeared
to the southward, cleaving the water at a
rapid rate. A quarter of an hour later Dr. Perkins
was hearing from the boys’ own lips the
strange story of their adventures of the past day
and night.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII.—THE DERELICT DESTROYER.</h2>
<p>
Assuredly it was a surprising sight that greeted
the eyes of Harry and Ben Stubbs as the latter
pulled the skiff around the point. Not half a
mile away lay a dull, gray-colored craft like a
gunboat, with the Stars and Stripes floating from
her stern. From her bow a puff of smoke was
drifting away, showing that she had been the
craft that had fired the shot which had aroused
them.
</p>
<p>
But what could she be doing? Above all, why
had the shot been fired? Harry’s eyes furnished
the answer as he saw that part of the rail of the
schooner was missing, a jagged break showing
where it had been torn away.
</p>
<p>
“Great guns!” shouted Ben, “they’ve bin firin’
at your old hulk.”
</p>
<p>
As he spoke there was a flash from the side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
of the lead-colored craft, and a projectile shrieked
by above the pair in the boat, causing them to
duck involuntarily.
</p>
<p>
“Cracky!” shouted Harry, “I’ve got it. That
craft is a derelict destroyer. One of Uncle Sam’s
craft whose duty it is to put obstructions to navigation
out of the way.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re right, boy, and they are bent on sending
that there <em>Betsy Jane</em> to the bottom.”
</p>
<p>
“We must stop them,” ejaculated Harry excitedly;
“that schooner is wanted by Mr. Perkins
to use in his experiments. That’s why he had
the runway built. We must signal them somehow.”
</p>
<p>
“No need to, lad. See, here comes a boat.”
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, as he spoke a cutter was lowered
from the warlike-looking vessel’s side, and before long,
impelled by muscular arms, it was flying
over the water toward the hulk.
</p>
<p>
“Pull round and meet them,” suggested Harry.
</p>
<p>
But Ben was already doing that very thing.
So fast did the government cutter approach that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
just as the skiff was rounding the stern of the
ill-used <em>Betsy Jane</em>, the former craft, with a
dapper young officer in the stern, was drawing
alongside the hulk.
</p>
<p>
The astonishment of the officer was great when
Harry explained matters.
</p>
<p>
“It’s lucky that I decided to make an examination
into the effect of the shots already fired before
I finished her up,” he laughed. “I am in
command of the United States derelict destroyer
<em>Seneca</em>, yonder. We’ve just despatched an old
hulk some miles out at sea, and when, on our return
down the coast, we saw your old hull, we
thought it was a good chance to try out a new
kind of gun we have to despatch these menaces
to navigation.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad we heard your first shot in time to
explain matters,” said Harry; “this craft belongs
to Dr. Perkins, the aëronautical inventor, who
wishes to use it in some experiments. As I told
you, I unfortunately drifted to sea in it when
some rascals cut the rope.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
The officer sympathized to the full with Harry
and offered to give him a spark plug for his
motor boat from a supply carried for a similar
craft on board the <em>Seneca</em>.
</p>
<p>
“But,” he continued, “I’ve got a better plan
than that. I’m bound down the coast. I know
Dr. Perkins slightly and should be glad to do him
a service. Why not accept a tow from me? I’ll
get you to Brig Island by nightfall anyway, and
that’s much quicker than you could tow this hulk
with the motor boat, even if you <em>could</em> get her
off the sand.”
</p>
<p>
Harry gladly agreed to this arrangement. A
line was made fast to the <em>Betsy Jane</em> and affixed
to the towing bitts of the derelict destroyer. The
tide by this time had turned, and after a short
struggle the <em>Betsy Jane</em> once more floated in deep
water.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know if this is exactly regular,” remarked
the young officer in command, when the
hulk lay bobbing astern of the trim and trig government
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
craft, “but I guess it’s all in the line of
duty. So come on board.”
</p>
<p>
Harry and Ben were in the skiff alongside the
<em>Betsy Jane</em> when this offer was made.
</p>
<p>
Without hesitation Harry stepped upon the
companionway. He turned to Ben, and was
about to bid that veteran adventurer good-by,
with a promise to visit Barren Island in the near
future, when, to his astonishment, Ben calmly
hitched his skiff alongside the motor boat and
stepped up after him.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon I’ve had about enough of that
island,” he said; “I’m a-goin’ to ship with you
on this cruise if it’s agreeable.”
</p>
<p>
“Agreeable?” laughed Harry. “Why, Ben,
you are as welcome as the flowers in May. But
haven’t you left a lot of stuff behind on the
island?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing that ’ull hurt. The only other suit
I own you’ve got on, and funny enough you look
in it, too,” and Ben chuckled; “as for the hut and
what grub’s left, and so forth, any one’s welcome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
to ’em that takes a fancy to ’em. I’ve got a bit
left in the bank yet, and I guess I can afford a
new outfit anyway, so heave ahead, Mister Skipper,
as soon as you’re ready.”
</p>
<p>
The officer, who had watched this scene in some
astonishment, broke into a laugh.
</p>
<p>
“I see you are an individual of impulse,” he
said, “but if you want to go along it will spare
my sending a man on board the schooner to help
our young friend.”
</p>
<p>
“Waal, then, it’s an arrangement that’s agreeable
to all parties,” rejoined Ben, lighting his
pipe; “so that’s all settled.”
</p>
<p>
A short time later the <em>Seneca</em> moved ahead, at
first slowly, and then faster, while the wandering
<em>Betsy Jane</em> followed docilely after her
through the now calm sea. True to Lieut. MacAllister’s
promise, they were off Brig Island by
sunset. As deep water extended close inshore,
the derelict destroyer was enabled to tow the
hulk almost up to the boys’ “front door,” so to
speak, and from the beach a little group set up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
a loud cheer as the <em>Betsy Jane’s</em> spare anchor
rattled down and she swung at rest.
</p>
<p>
The presence of the little party to witness the
arrival is due to the fact that Lieut. MacAllister,
who knew from Harry that there was a wireless
on the island, had kept his operator busy sending
“bulletins” to Dr. Perkins all the way down
the coast; and so, when first the <em>Seneca’s</em> smoke
streaked the horizon, all was ready to give the
returned wanderer a big reception.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Betsy Jane</em>, having been safely anchored,
the <em>Seneca</em>, with three toots of her siren, departed
on her way, while Harry and Ben lost no time in
tumbling into the skiff and rowing ashore. To
describe what took place then would take up a
lot of space without giving any clearer picture
of the reunion that each of you can imagine for
himself.
</p>
<p>
Readers of the former volumes of this series
know how highly the Boy Aviators regarded Ben
Stubbs, and after a short conversation with him
Dr. Perkins came to share their good opinion of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
the rugged old adventurer. It would be impossible
to tell with accuracy how many times that
night Harry’s story was told, and how many
times Frank and the others repeated the tale of
their anxious hours while he was missing. The
first wireless flash from the <em>Seneca</em>, Frank described
as “the best thing that ever happened.”
This opinion the others heartily echoed.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Dr. Perkins, as at last they made
ready to “turn in,” “all is well that ends well,
and to-morrow I have an announcement of some
interest to make to you lads. From my inspection
of the work done so far on the ‘<em>Sea Eagle</em>,’
as I have decided to christen her, I think that
within a few days we can take her on her trial
trip.”
</p>
<p>
“Anchors and aëroplanes!” shouted Pudge, in
high glee, “I book passage right now!”
</p>
<p>
“And I—and I—and I,” came from the others,
while Ben Stubbs inquired plaintively if there
would be room for him.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX.—THE FLIGHT OF THE “SEA EAGLE.”</h2>
<p>
Having already given a brief description of
Dr. Perkins’ <em>Sea Eagle</em>, it would be wearisome to
dwell in detail on all that was done during the
next week to put that craft in shape for the final
tests, upon which so much depended. It may
be said here, though, that besides a visit paid to
Motthaven in an effort to secure the apprehension
of the two Daniels, a search was prosecuted
for the missing dinghy. Neither mission proved
successful.
</p>
<p>
The Daniels, having discovered that Harry
was on board the <em>Betsy Jane</em> after they cut that
craft loose, had vanished from the little community.
As for the dinghy, it was supposed that
they had taken that small craft with them. At
any rate, it was impossible to get any news of
their whereabouts on shore. This may be attributed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
to a distinct prejudice felt by the fishing
community against the dwellers on Brig Island.
Your down-easter is inquisitive to a degree, and
the secrecy under which operations on the island
were carried on was felt as a distinct affront to
the little town. So therefore, although the local
authorities promised every co-operation in seeking
out the Daniels and punishing them for their
outrageous conduct, it may be doubted if the efforts
went much further than the mere assurance.
</p>
<p>
But after all, in the rush of interesting work
that was now on hand, the Daniels were almost
forgotten. The <em>Betsy Jane</em> had been towed round
into the nearer cove, where she could be constantly
watched, and the motor boat was used in
the operation, the officer of the derelict destroyer
having fulfilled his promise to furnish the boys
with a new spark plug for the engine in place of
the one taken by the marauders.
</p>
<p>
The morning after Harry’s return to the island
Dr. Perkins had laid down a systematic plan of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
action. Frank and Harry were assigned to aid
him in giving the finishing touches to the <em>Sea
Eagle</em>, while his son and Billy Barnes were set
to work with axes to clear a sort of runway down
to the beach. Both Billy and Pudge would much
rather have had a hand in the mechanical part
of the work, but they pluckily went ahead on
their designated duty and stuck to it till a broad
path had been cleared from the summit of the
island to the margin of the beach.
</p>
<p>
When this “roadway” through the brush had
been cleared, two lines of planking, firmly nailed
to stout supports, were run down on each side
of it, forming a sort of railway, similar to those
from which vessels are launched.
</p>
<p>
It was down this runway that it was designed
to introduce the <em>Sea Eagle</em> to her initial plunge.
At last the day arrived when all was complete,
and the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was pronounced fit for the
test. During the night before this event not one
of the boys got more than half his usual allowance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
of sleep. In fact, it is doubtful if Dr. Perkins
enjoyed much more repose.
</p>
<p>
By earliest dawn they were out, to find every
promise of a glorious day. Breakfast that morning
was a hasty apology for a meal, and hardly
had it been gulped down before all hands were
in the <em>Sea Eagle’s</em> shed. As has been said, the
boat-like underbody of the craft had been
mounted on a wheeled frame before it was assembled.
All that had to be done then to get
everything in readiness for the final test was to
make fast a block and tackle to a stoutly rooted
tree, and then wheel the <em>Sea Eagle</em> to the top
of the inclined runway.
</p>
<p>
When the odd-looking craft was safely poised
on the top of the rails the loose end of the tackle
was made fast to the stern of the substructure,
and Billy, Pudge and Harry were delegated to
“belay” the rope as required. Frank and Dr.
Perkins seated themselves in the “boat,” and at
the words “Let her go!” the <em>Sea Eagle</em> in her
wheeled frame began her descent down the runway. By
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
means of the tackle the three boys at
the summit of the incline easily controlled the
novel craft’s descent, stopping from time to time
while Dr. Perkins and Frank made a survey to
see that all was going well.
</p>
<p>
“Bunting and buttercakes!” grumbled Pudge,
as the boys alternately “let go” and “hauled in”
on the tackle, “I thought a launching was more
of a gala event than this.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess the doctor is too anxious to test out
the <em>Sea Eagle</em> to bother with the trimmings,”
laughed Harry; “it’s <em>results</em> that he’s after.”
</p>
<p>
As a matter of fact, the launching of the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> was a very mild affair compared with what
might have been expected. Had the villagers
ashore known of it, doubtless a small fleet of
boats would have been lying off the cove to witness
it, but it was for that very reason that the
deepest secrecy had been observed, and that the
early hour had been chosen. As Dr. Perkins
said, he “didn’t want any fuss and feathers”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
made over what was merely, after all, an experiment.
</p>
<p>
The rolling glide down the runway was made
without incident, and at last the bow of the <em>Sea
Eagle’s</em> “hull” struck the water. A cheer went
up then that, rang shrill and clear out over the
calm sea. Even Dr. Perkins joined in the enthusiasm,
as well he might, for the goal of his
ambition was in sight at last.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Sea Eagle</em> had been sent on her initial
voyage without the aëroplane wings or the auxiliary
lifting bags being attached. It was desired,
first of all, to try out her qualities as a
water skimmer. As soon as she was fairly
afloat, the wheeled carriage on which the descent
had been made was drawn ashore. Having been
weighted before the start was made, it of course
sank under the <em>Sea Eagle</em> when the sea and air
craft floated, thus allowing it to be reclaimed
with ease.
</p>
<p>
“Looks like a butterfly with its wings clipped
off,” commented Billy Barnes as, with the others,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
he hastened to the beach as soon as their task
was over.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the odd-shaped hull, with its naked
frame and two gaunt aërial propellers, did look
strangely incomplete. But the boys knew that
the wings were all ready for instant attachment.
In fact, it was one of the features of the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> that the craft was capable of being taken
to pieces and put together again with very little
loss of time or labor.
</p>
<p>
As the hydroplane portion of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
floated clear of the weighted frame in which it
had made its journey to the beach, Frank looked
inquiringly at the inventor. His hand was on
the self-starting device which put the powerful
motor in operation. Dr. Perkins was actually
pale, and Frank could see that his strong hand
shook perceptibly as he nodded his head.
</p>
<p>
But he mastered his nervousness quickly, and,
grasping the steering-wheel in a firm grip, he
spoke:
</p>
<p>
“You can start up now,” he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
Frank turned the starting handle, admitting a
charge of gas to the cylinders. Then he pressed
a button and instantly the motor responded with
a roar and a series of explosions, like those of a
battery of gatling guns going into action. Having
started it he admitted gasolene, and adjusted
the carburetor till the cylinders were all working
steadily.
</p>
<p>
Close to Dr. Perkins’ hand was a lever. This,
when moved, “threw in” the clutch connecting
the motor with the driving mechanism. Directly
Frank had finished tuning up the motor Dr. Perkins’
hand reached for the lever. He jerked it
nervously back. There was a whirr and a buzz,
as the chains whirled the twin propellers round,
and at the same instant the <em>Sea Eagle</em> darted forward
like an arrow from a bow.
</p>
<p>
Faster and faster she went, getting up speed
with seemingly marvelous rapidity. But instead
of driving deeper into the water, under the
pressure of the aërial propellers which rushed
her forward through the atmosphere, the faster
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was driven the more lightly did
the craft skim the surface of the water, till at
top speed—2,000 revolutions a minute—her bottom
barely touched the water. This was owing
to the peculiar construction of the hull, which
was designed so as to “plane” the water in exactly
the manner it did.
</p>
<p>
Cheer after cheer broke from the lads on shore
as they saw the swift craft dart off, slicing the
tops of the small waves like a cream skimmer.
Dr. Perkins circumnavigated the island three
times before he gave the signal to Frank to slow
down. Then, releasing the clutch, the inventor
allowed the <em>Sea Eagle</em> to come to rest, with its
bow almost touching the beach.
</p>
<p>
“Now we will have a weight test,” he announced;
“come on, boys.”
</p>
<p>
The lads ashore surely needed no second invitation.
Without bothering to remove shoes or
stockings they waded into the water and out to
the <em>Sea Eagle’s</em> side. In less time than it takes
to tell it they were swarming over the side of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
cockpit and struggling for positions near the engine.
But Dr. Perkins made them arrange themselves
so that their weight would be evenly distributed.
Ben Stubbs and Harry sat in the extreme
stern, while Pudge and Billy occupied opposite
seats amidships.
</p>
<p>
This done, off darted the <em>Sea Eagle</em> once more,
and speedily set at rest all doubts as to her capability
to “plane,” or skim the water, under an
added load.
</p>
<p>
“It’s like riding on a floating island over a sea
of raspberry ice cream soda,” declared Billy,
when he was asked later to describe his sensations.
</p>
<p>
But a severer test awaited the <em>Sea Eagle</em>,
namely, the trying out of her capacity actually
to rise into the air. The craft was run partially
ashore, and the great wings bolted in place and
the stay wires adjusted. The stay wires were
tightened by turn buckles till they were taut as
fiddle strings, assuring stability of the wings.
But in addition the wings were, of course, partially
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
supported on the light but strong skeleton
framework before noticed.
</p>
<p>
Much to the disappointment of the others, only
Frank and Harry Chester and Dr. Perkins were
to participate in the flying trials. But they took
it all in good part, being promised rides later if
the tests were successful. As before, the <em>Sea
Eagle</em>, after she had been backed off and the propellers
started, skimmed along the top of the
water like a flying fish. But all at once the
watchers on shore saw her rise bodily from the
water and soar upward into the air. Higher and
higher went the craft, gliding like a gull through
the ether. It was an inspiring sight, and a perfect
tornado of yells broke from Ben Stubbs,
Billy and Pudge. But those on board the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> could not hear the sounds of enthusiasm
above the roaring of the motor.
</p>
<p>
Under Dr. Perkins’ skillful guidance the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> climbed the aërial staircase till a height
shown by the barograph to be almost 4,000 feet
had been attained.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now to test the buoyancy apparatus,” cried
the doctor suddenly. “Shut off power, Frank.”
</p>
<p>
Frank, who knew what was coming, obeyed
the order and turned a valve admitting the pure
hydrogen gas from one of the cylinders into the
buoyancy devices. Instantly the upper wings
swelled, till they resembled puffed-out mattresses
more than anything else, and the “volplaning”
downward movement was perceptibly checked.
But, setting the descending device, Dr. Perkins
headed the <em>Sea Eagle</em> for the water, and, skillfully
manipulating the craft, landed it as lightly
as a drifting feather on the water by the hull of
the <em>Betsy Jane</em>.
</p>
<p>
Now came a further trial of the capabilities of
the wonderful new craft which, so far, had
proven such a success. Dr. Perkins set the planes
in a rising position and allowed the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
to hover above the <em>Betsy Jane</em>, like the bird for
which the aërial craft had been named. Then
suddenly he began a rapid descent, landing finally
on the very summit of the inclined runway before mentioned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
The sides of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
were equipped with large metal hooks, which
were hastily thrown out by the boys and attached
to four “eyes” arranged to receive them.
</p>
<p>
When this had been done the suction pump
was set to work, and the inflated wings emptied
of the gas, which was forced back into its receiver,
and the valve closed. It was calculated
that less than two per cent of the gas was lost
during the process. The <em>Sea Eagle</em> was now once
more a simple hydroplane, without any buoyancy
device.
</p>
<p>
At a word from Dr. Perkins the hooks which
had held the machine in place were disengaged,
and instantly the craft began to glide down the
runway. Half way down the engine was started,
and when the graceful craft reached the abrupt
end of the incline, the <em>Sea Eagle</em> went soaring
off into space like a huge white-winged bird.
This test was regarded by Dr. Perkins as the
most important, for it proved the entire practicability
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
of launching the <em>Sea Eagle</em> from a ship
far out on the ocean.
</p>
<p>
After circling in the air a few times the tests
were concluded by a rapid drop toward the earth
right above the summit of the island. Just as it
seemed as if the new craft must end her career
by being dashed to bits against the construction
shed, a skillful twist of the steering device sent
her soaring upward once more. Two more
swinging aërial loops were described, and then,
with hardly a jar or vibration, the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
was brought to rest by her inventor, almost in
front of the shed where she had been assembled.
</p>
<p>
As the thrilling and wonderful trip was concluded,
the boys came pressing about Dr. Perkins,
showering congratulations and good wishes.
</p>
<p>
“Why, one could fly across the ocean in such
a craft,” declared Frank enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
The others laughed, but, to their astonishment,
Dr. Perkins looked perfectly serious.
</p>
<p>
“I have a long trip in view,” he said, “a flight
that will test every wire and bolt in the <em>Sea</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
<em>Eagle’s</em> construction. I did not announce this
before for I wished first to see if everything
worked satisfactorily.”
</p>
<p>
“No doubt about that,” said Billy Barnes with
enthusiasm. He had been dodging about the
great flying machine, taking photos from every
possible angle.
</p>
<p>
“No,” admitted Dr. Perkins; “I must say that
so far the <em>Sea Eagle</em> is all that I could desire.
But the final test will put that beyond the shadow
of a doubt. Do you boys wish to undertake a
long trip?”
</p>
<p>
“Cookies and cucumbers! Do we!” roared
Pudge, as the others pressed eagerly about to
hear the unveiling of the doctor’s plan.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X.—“C. Q. D.!”</h2>
<p>
But they were compelled to curb their impatience
till that evening after supper, for the doctor
set every one busily to work “stabling” the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> and attending to the engines after the
hard test they had undergone. Every part was
carefully gone over, and it was found that despite
the strain of the novel craft’s first try-out, nothing
save a few minor adjustments were required.
</p>
<p>
“Now, dad,” said Pudge, after the dishes had
been washed and Ben had his pipe going, and
the others were perched on the edge of the lower
bunks, like so many birds on a rail, “now, then,
dad, we are ready to hear your plans for that
cruise.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins smiled.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid, my boy,” he said, “that you are
in for a disappointment. While I thoroughly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
believe the <em>Sea Eagle</em> is capable of conveying our
whole party through almost anything, I am unwilling
to place too great a burden on her at her
first long-distance trial.”
</p>
<p>
Pudge’s face lengthened.
</p>
<p>
“Oceans and octopuses!” he groaned, “I s’pose
I’m to be left behind, as usual.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid it will be necessary,” was the reply;
“you see, there will only be room under my
present plan for experienced navigators. But
not to keep you in suspense any longer, my present
plan is to cruise down the coast to Florida,
round that peninsula, and then fly up to New
Orleans, and then possibly I might test out the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> still further on a flight up the Mississippi.”
</p>
<p>
“Wow! And we’re to miss all that?”
</p>
<p>
“Not <em>all</em> of it, Pudge,” smiled the doctor. “I
was planning to send you and Billy on ahead to
meet us at New Orleans and make arrangements
for our arrival there.”
</p>
<p>
“Cookies and catamounts! That’s not so bad.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
I’ve always longed to see New Orleans. But,
then, would you take us with you up the Mississippi?”
</p>
<p>
“If we go—yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Look a-here,” struck in Ben’s bass voice at
this point, “I don’t want to butt in, or nothing
like that, doctor; but this here is a cruise that
just suits me. Would you have any objection
if I went along with ther boys ter New Orleans?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I hadn’t thought of it,” confessed Dr.
Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“You see, I’ve got some partic’lar business
down that way,” said Ben, with a portentous
wink at Harry; “ain’t I, Harry?”
</p>
<p>
The boy addressed instantly guessed that Ben
referred to the supposed treasure trove lying at
the bottom of the Black Bayou. Now, in the
rush of events following Harry’s return from his
strange cruise on the <em>Betsy Jane</em>, he had quite
forgotten about Raoul Duval’s map. But now
it flashed back on him, and the recollection caused
him to flush with excitement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins looked puzzled, while a glance of
intelligence shot between the grizzled old adventurer
and the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Have I got your leave to tell about the sunken
steamer?” inquired Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Sure. Heave ahead, my boy,” was the hearty
answer; “I was never much of a hand at spinning
a yarn.”
</p>
<p>
“Pirates and petticoats! What’s all this about
a yarn and a sunken ship?” demanded Pudge.
</p>
<p>
“Sounds like some fresh adventure. Anything
like the Buena Ventura cruise?” asked Billy
Barnes, referring, of course, to their experiences
in the Sargasso Sea.
</p>
<p>
“I hope not,” laughed Harry. “No, this is a
much tamer affair,” he continued. “Ben, here,
thinks that he knows of a craft sunk in a bayou
off the Mississippi, on board of which is a small
fortune in gold dust and black pearls.”
</p>
<p>
“Gold dust and black pearls!” cried Billy
Barnes. “Wow! that sounds like a regular
story.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
“Suppose we let Harry heave ahead, as Ben
calls it, and tell us what all this is about,” suggested
Frank quietly. But his eyes were shining.
He knew that what Harry was about to communicate
must be of deep interest from the manner
in which the boy had spoken.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, let us hear the story,” said Dr. Perkins;
“since we plan to be down in that region, anything
of interest to be investigated will add to
the pleasure of the trip.”
</p>
<p>
Thereupon Harry, without further delay,
plunged into the narrative as Ben had related
it to him. He was interrupted from time to time
by excited exclamations, but at last he finished
his narration and then, turning to Dr. Perkins,
he said:
</p>
<p>
“What do you think of it, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye,” growled out Ben, “supposin’ the
yarn is true, have I got a legal right to the
stuff?”
</p>
<p>
“Undoubtedly, if you have papers assigning
the claim to you,” said Mr. Perkins, after a moment’s
thought.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ve got them fast enough. I was goin’
to chuck ’em away, but I thought better of it.
Glad I did now, but you see I never thought I’d
have a chance to go down there.”
</p>
<p>
Ben reached into his pocket and drew out a battered,
brown leather wallet. From it he produced
Raoul Duval’s promise to deed him his (Duval’s)
interest in the supposed treasure chest, providing
the loan Ben had made the mining man’s son was
not repaid. He handed the document to Dr. Perkins,
who perused it with knitted brows.
</p>
<p>
“This certainly appears to give you a legal
claim to whatever may be of value in the late
Duval’s effects,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Then you think it is worth looking into?”
</p>
<p>
“By all means. While the story sounds fanciful
to a degree, it is not much more so than
plenty of recorded cases. At all events, no harm
can be done by trying to locate the wreck, and
it may be the means of rehabilitating your fortunes.”
</p>
<p>
“I dunno what that means,” grinned Ben, “but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
if it signifies that I’m to get some money out
of the cruise, I’m willing right now to split it up
any way it suits you.”
</p>
<p>
“We can talk about that later,” said Dr. Perkins,
with a smile at the old man’s enthusiasm;
“now would you mind letting me have a look at
that map to which Harry has referred?”
</p>
<p>
“Here it be,” grunted Ben, once more diving
into the wallet and producing the map that Harry
had looked over on Barren Island.
</p>
<p>
“At any rate, this looks definite enough,” declared
Dr. Perkins after a careful examination
of it. “Of course, as this Duval appears to be a
thorough rascal, he may have ‘cooked this up,’
as the saying goes, in order to induce you to
make him a loan. But certain things about it
make me believe that it may be genuine. I recall
reading some time ago a newspaper account of
mysteries of the Mississippi, and among them
was an account of the serious disaster to the
<em>Belle of New Orleans</em>, so, at any rate, that part
of the story is authentic enough.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
“Meanin’ it’s true,” murmured Ben. “Waal,
if you’ll help me we’ll soon find out the truth of
it, or otherwise.”
</p>
<p>
“As I said,” rejoined Dr. Perkins, “I had intended
to cruise up the Mississippi from New
Orleans. What you have told us furnishes us
with a distinct object in making the trip, and,”
he added with a smile, “I suppose the spice of
adventure about it does not displease the lads
here.”
</p>
<p>
Frank was about to reply when, from the wireless
table, there came a queer buzzing sound from
an instrument which the boy had connected with
his detector.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo! some one is sending out a message,”
he exclaimed, “and our wires have caught it.
Wonder what it can be.”
</p>
<p>
The boy rose and went over to the wireless
table. Seating himself on the stool in front of
the instruments he adjusted the “phones” and
began putting his variable condenser in tune to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
catch whatever message was pulsing through the
air.
</p>
<p>
“What’s coming?” demanded Harry, as the instruments
began to crackle and snap.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t know yet,” spoke Frank, again changing
the capacity of the condenser; “looks as
if——”
</p>
<p>
He ceased speaking suddenly. Sliding his
hand across the table he made an adjustment to
catch longer sound waves. Instantly a hail of
aërial dots and dashes came pattering against
his ear drums, like rain on a window pane.
</p>
<p>
With startling suddenness Frank sensed the
meaning of the storm of desperate flashes.
</p>
<p>
“C-Q-D! C-Q-D! C-Q-D!”
</p>
<p>
“Some one out at sea is calling us in distress!”
he cried loudly. The others, brim full of excitement,
rose and crowded about him. But Frank
waved them back.
</p>
<p>
“No questions yet, please!” he said sharply,
and then bent all his faculties to catching the
voice out of the black night.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI.—“GOOD LUCK!”</h2>
<p>
The silence in the hut was absolute as Frank
bent low over his instruments. Even Pudge was
subdued for once. There is something thrillingly
dramatic to the most phlegmatic of temperaments
in the idea of a wireless call for aid. Across unknown
miles the message comes winging through
the air—an appeal out of space.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the others could not catch what was
coming, for the whisper of the wireless waves
sounds faint and shadowy even to one with the
“phones” clasped to his ears. But Frank’s manner
showed plainly enough that, whatever was
winging its way to his organs of hearing, was
exciting to the last degree.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the boy switched to his transmitting
apparatus. With his helix he began attuning the
length of his sparks, while the snake-like blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
flame hissed and crackled across the “high-efficiency”
spark gap. It looked like a living thing
of lambent fire, as it writhed and screamed in
response to the pressure on the key.
</p>
<p>
“What’s wanted? Where are you?”
</p>
<p>
This was the message that went speeding out
on the air waves from the aërials above the hut.
</p>
<p>
“This is the yacht <em>Wanderer</em>, from New York
to Rocktown. We have struck a derelict and are
leaking badly. Who are you?”
</p>
<p>
“A station on Brig Island, about four miles
at sea from Motthaven. Where are you?”
</p>
<p>
The latter question was unanswered for the
time being. Instead came another query:
</p>
<p>
“Have you any means by which you can get
to our assistance? We are in dire peril.”
</p>
<p>
“We will try to aid you. But what is your position?”
</p>
<p>
“Wait. I’ll look at the chart.”
</p>
<p>
There came a pause, during which Frank rapidly
detailed what he had heard to the eager
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
group of listeners. But in the midst of it the
unknown sender broke in once more.
</p>
<p>
“We are about twenty miles to the southeast
of you, on an almost straight course. Can keep
afloat only a few hours longer. Can you get tug
from the mainland?”
</p>
<p>
“Impossible,” flashed back Frank, “but will do
what we can. Are you at anchor?”
</p>
<p>
“No, but the drift is very little. We are off
soundings. Can you come to our aid?”
</p>
<p>
Frank’s fingers pressed down on the key firmly.
Rapidly he sent this message pulsating:
</p>
<p>
“How many on board?”
</p>
<p>
“Three. Owner, a friend and a hand.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. Standby!”
</p>
<p>
“Good-by, and hurry,” came out of the night,
and then—silence.
</p>
<p>
Frank disconnected his instruments and turned
to the others. Rapidly he detailed the impending
tragedy out there in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t we get to them in the motor boat?” demanded
Harry breathlessly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
Frank shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Not in the time we have. They can’t keep
afloat much longer, recollect. What can be done?
Is there no way we can help them?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, there is.”
</p>
<p>
The words came quietly but in a decided tone
from Dr. Perkins. Frank was the first to guess
the import of the speech.
</p>
<p>
“The <em>Sea Eagle</em>!” he exclaimed excitedly.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Here is our chance to test her in the
service of humanity. She is ready for flight this
instant.”
</p>
<p>
“But in the darkness? How can we pick up
this yacht?”
</p>
<p>
“By the searchlight. Most likely the yacht has
rockets. When she sees our searchlight she will
send some up. That will give us her bearings.
The general location of the craft we know.”
</p>
<p>
“Are we all to go?” demanded Pudge.
</p>
<p>
“Hardly,” rejoined his father, slipping into
an overcoat, for the night was somewhat chilly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
though the air was calm. “Frank and Harry, I
need you two. You others await our return.
Have hot coffee and food ready, as the survivors
may be in need of nourishment.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir,” responded Ben; “and now, sir,
if I may give a bit of advice, lose no time in getting
away. I’ve been in some sea disasters myself,
and sometimes every second counts.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re right, Stubbs,” ejaculated Dr. Perkins.
“Boys, get the <em>Sea Eagle</em> ready. I’ll bring along
the searchlight.”
</p>
<p>
While Frank and Harry hastened on their errand,
Dr. Perkins got the searchlight out of its
locker. It was a small but powerful one, constructed
so as to fit into a socket on the <em>Sea
Eagle’s</em> “bow.” Its light was supplied from a
small dynamo connected with the engine of the
sea-and-air craft. By the time the doctor was
ready the <em>Sea Eagle</em> had been wheeled out of her
shed, and Frank gave a sharp hail.
</p>
<p>
“All ready, doctor!”
</p>
<p>
“With you in a moment, my boy,” was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
response, as the inventor hastened out into the
darkness.
</p>
<p>
The outlines of the <em>Sea Eagle</em> loomed up gray
and ghostly in the gloom. Only a tiny speck of
light showed in her bow by the steering wheel,
where a minute electric bulb shed light on the
compass. This light was obtained from a storage
battery of peculiarly light construction, connected
with the dynamo before mentioned.
</p>
<p>
The boys had clambered on board as soon as
the airship had been wheeled out of its shed.
They extended their hands to Dr. Perkins and
helped him on board. The searchlight was put
in place and its wires connected to the storage
battery. A snap of a switch and a sharp pencil
of light cut the night. The appliance worked
to perfection.
</p>
<p>
“Now, then,” said the doctor, as he took the
wheel, “the less time we lose, the better. Frank,
you had better apply the buoyancy apparatus, as
we must make an abrupt rise to clear the trees.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why not launch from the runway?” inquired
Frank; “wouldn’t that be quicker?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right. I think it would. Head the
prow round for the rails.”
</p>
<p>
Willing hands pushed the <em>Sea Eagle</em> around,
for on her ball-bearing supporting wheels she
handled very easily, despite her great weight.
</p>
<p>
Presently the craft was poised at the summit
of the incline, ready for her rush downward.
</p>
<p>
“Give her power!” cried the doctor.
</p>
<p>
Frank seized the self-starting lever, and gave
it a twirl. A pressure of his forefinger on the
button followed, and almost simultaneously the
motor began to thunder and roar.
</p>
<p>
“Right here!” cried Frank.
</p>
<p>
“All right. Hold tight. I’m going to apply
full power.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins jerked back the clutch lever as
he spoke. There was a jarring shock, and then
a downward rush through the night, the searchlight
cutting a blazing white path through the
blackness. Down, down they raced at terrific
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
speed. Suddenly the jarring movement ceased.
The <em>Sea Eagle</em> appeared to glide upward as if
drawn skyward by invisible ropes. As the craft
left the rails, and began soaring to the stars that
looked quietly down on the exciting scene, a
sound was borne upward to the aërial voyagers.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by.”
</p>
<p>
And then an instant later in Ben’s stentorian
tones:
</p>
<p>
“So long, mates! Go-o-o-d luck!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII.—THROUGH THE NIGHT.</h2>
<p>
Up and out into the night winged the great sea-and-air
craft, the powerful motors working without
a skip, and the propellers beating the air with
a noise like the drone of a mastadonic bee—or
more appropriately, night beetle. Above shone
the stars, steady points of brightness in the dark
blue canopy of heavens; below stretched the
silent, empty sea, heaving gently. The air was
calm and still, and the <em>Sea Eagle</em> cleaved her way
through it powerfully. Dr. Perkins set the course
at due southeast, and kept a careful eye on the
compass.
</p>
<p>
“What speed are we making?” shouted Frank
presently.
</p>
<p>
The inventor glanced at the aërial speed meter,
a device of his own invention.
</p>
<p>
“Close to fifty,” he shouted back, for, owing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
to the roar of the engines and propellers, it was
necessary to raise the voice in speaking to any
one at a distance.
</p>
<p>
“Then we should be in the vicinity in half an
hour?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; that is unless——”
</p>
<p>
But Dr. Perkins broke off abruptly. The <em>Sea
Eagle</em> had now attained a height of some five
hundred feet, at which altitude he intended to
keep the craft till they reached the vicinity of
the disabled yacht.
</p>
<p>
The cause of the sudden breaking off of his
shouted remarks was this: Without the slightest
warning the <em>Sea Eagle</em> gave a sickening dip
downward, and rushed toward the sea; or rather,
to those in the falling ship, it seemed as if the
sea was racing up devouringly toward them.
</p>
<p>
“Gracious, what’s happened?” shouted Harry.
</p>
<p>
But Frank was too busy with the engine to answer
just then.
</p>
<p>
“Power! Give me lots of power!” yelled Dr.
Perkins.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
</p>
<p>
But although Frank instantly opened up the
motor to its full capacity of two thousand revolutions
a minute, the downward rush still continued.
</p>
<p>
“The sea! We’ll be plunged into the sea!”
cried Harry, in alarm, gripping a side support.
</p>
<p>
Indeed there appeared to be good cause for his
apprehension, for the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was falling like
a stone flung into space. All this, of course, took
place in far less time than it takes to describe
or to read it. In fact, hardly had Harry shouted
his fears before the <em>Sea Eagle’s</em> “hull”—as we
must call the hydroplane part of the craft—struck
the water, and a huge cloud of spray flew
high on either side.
</p>
<p>
But instead of diving, the <em>Sea Eagle</em> shot forward
over the waves, gliding over their tops for
some time before Frank shut off the motor.
Even then such was the “shooting” velocity
gained, that the <em>Sea Eagle</em> still continued to scoot
along until the young engineer, in response to
Dr. Perkins’ instructions, reversed her propellers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
and thus brought the craft to a speedy standstill.
</p>
<p>
“What on earth happened?” demanded Frank
anxiously, as the <em>Sea Eagle</em> lay still, bobbing up
and down on the gentle swell.
</p>
<p>
“We struck an air pocket. An empty hole in
space where there was no ether to support us,”
explained Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“Gracious; I thought we were goners,” cried
Harry, still a little shaky over the fearful sensation
of the fall.
</p>
<p>
“Had the <em>Sea Eagle</em> been of different construction
we should have dived as straight to the bottom
as a loon,” said the inventor, “but the spoonlike
construction of the bow allowed me to handle
her so that, instead of the impulse of the fall
being downward, it was diverted into a forward
movement along the surface.”
</p>
<p>
“Shall we go up again?” asked Frank, after a
hasty examination had been made to ascertain if
anything had parted or snapped under the strain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
of the suddenly arrested tumble through the air
pocket.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. We had better lose as little time as possible,”
was the rejoinder. “If you are ready,
start the engine up, and we will try a flight from
the surface of the water.”
</p>
<p>
“You want full power?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but start up gently at first, gradually
increasing to top velocity. I think, however, that
we shall leave the water at about 1,500 revolutions
a minute.”
</p>
<p>
The next minute the roar of the newly started
engine prevented further conversation. In order
to develop every ounce of power of which the
motor was capable Frank had opened the muffler
cut-out, and the uproar was terrific. Spurts of
greenish flame spouted from the exhausts, and
the acrid smell of burning oil and gasolene filled
the air. To any one less accustomed than the
Boy Aviators to the uproar of aërial motors, the
noise would have been alarming to say the least.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
They, however, were too much used to such
scenes to pay any attention to it.
</p>
<p>
Faster and faster the <em>Sea Eagle</em> sped over the
waves, till her keel barely touched the tips of
the swells. Then suddenly the jerky motion
ceased, and the craft, buoyed by its wings, began
to soar upward in a steadily increasing gradient.
Before ten minutes had passed they were once
more on an even keel at a five-hundred-feet altitude,
and bearing steadily for the southwest.
</p>
<p>
Frank looked at his watch.
</p>
<p>
“We ought to be getting pretty close to that
yacht by now,” he remarked to Harry, who had
seated himself at his side, and was assisting in
attending to the lubrication and watching of the
motor.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll keep a sharp lookout,” rejoined Harry;
“they surely ought to hear the noise of our motor
and send up a rocket or wave lights, or something,
if they are in the vicinity.
</p>
<p>
“That’s just what I think. Keep your eyes
open while I watch the engine.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
Harry peered out into the night, but as far as
he could see nothing appeared but the reflection
of the stars in the water to relieve its blackness.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t see anything yet,” he said, after a
while.
</p>
<p>
“Just keep on looking,” rejoined Frank;
“there’s a chance that they may have drifted
from the position they gave us.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, in any case it would have been impossible
for us to fly direct to the spot,” rejoined
Harry; “this thing is a good deal like looking
for a needle in a haystack, to my way of thinking.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not so sure of that. If they are anywhere
within five or six miles they must hear the
beat of our motor.”
</p>
<p>
“Wonder why Dr. Perkins doesn’t switch on
the searchlight. Hullo, there it goes now.”
</p>
<p>
As Harry spoke, a fan-shaped ray of brilliant
white light cut the night in front of the <em>Sea
Eagle</em>, like a radiant sword. Hither and thither
it swept over the dark sea; but it revealed nothing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
All at once Dr. Perkins shut the searchlight
off.
</p>
<p>
“If they have seen it they will reply in some
way,” he shouted in explanation to the boys.
“Keep a bright lookout for an answer. I’ll keep
the <em>Sea Eagle</em> swinging in circles. We have
been doing thirty miles an hour, and even allowing
for the delay when we struck the air pocket
we ought to be in the disabled yacht’s vicinity
by this time.”
</p>
<p>
As the searchlight was extinguished Harry
peered out into the darkness with straining eyes.
Suddenly he gave a shout and clutched Frank’s
arm.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that,” he shouted, “that light off
there to the south?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a lantern,” cried Frank; “somebody’s
waving it.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins confirmed Frank’s supposition,
and the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, on her errand of rescue, was
headed for the swinging pin-point of light in
the distance.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII.—A TWENTIETH-CENTURY RESCUE.</h2>
<p>
As he flew his craft in the direction of the
feeble beacon of distress, Dr. Perkins once more
switched on the searchlight. Its comforting
beam shot across the sea, and finally ceased its
swaying and centered on a strange sight. As a
dark scene in a theater is illumined at one single
point by the calcium light, so the search rays
concentrated themselves on a striking picture of
distress at sea.
</p>
<p>
Framed in the circle of white light the boys
could see a small gasolene craft, apparently up
to the rails in the water. At any rate nothing
of the hull but a narrow white strip could be seen,
while, on the top of the raised deck cabin crouched
the figures of three men. One of these had been
swinging the lantern, but he ceased as the bright
light from the <em>Sea Eagle</em> bathed the group in its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
rays. One single mast arose high above the
pitching hull, and from it could be seen wires
strung down to the cabin top. Evidently this
was the wireless apparatus which had been the
means of bringing the Boy Aviators and their
friend to the rescue.
</p>
<p>
The yacht could not have been more than fifty
feet in length—a very small craft to be equipped
with wireless; but her owner, if he was on board,
must have been congratulating himself at that
very moment on his wise precaution.
</p>
<p>
It was but a few minutes after the searchlight
had first revealed the <em>Wanderer</em> and her distressed
company that the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was swinging
in a graceful, birdlike circle in the air above
the sinking craft.
</p>
<p>
Frank seized up a small megaphone, which
formed part of the sea and sky ship’s equipment.
</p>
<p>
“Ahoy! Aboard the yacht!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
“Ahoy!” came back the cry, with a note of incredulous
wonder in it, as well there might be,
considering the extraordinary circumstances.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
“Are you the folks we talked with by wireless?”
called Harry.
</p>
<p>
“The very same,” was the shouted reply, “but
who are you? Can you get us off this? The
ship won’t last much longer.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll get you off all right,” exclaimed Frank
comfortingly, and as he spoke Dr. Perkins allowed
the <em>Sea Eagle</em> to glide down to the surface
of the waves, alighting on the water about
five hundred feet from the castaways. He at
once headed the <em>Sea Eagle</em> round, and calling
for reduced speed made for the sinking yacht.
</p>
<p>
“Slow down! Stop her! Reverse!” he shouted
in rapid succession, as they bore down.
</p>
<p>
“On board the yacht!” hailed Frank, as they
glided up alongside, “throw us a line.”
</p>
<p>
The desired rope came snaking through the air,
falling across the <em>Sea Eagle’s</em> bow. Harry
bounded forward and made it fast.
</p>
<p>
“Now haul in,” ordered Dr. Perkins, as soon
as the propellers had ceased to beat the air; “easy
now; we don’t want to foul the wings.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
His order was obeyed; and before long the
<em>Sea Eagle’s</em> bow was scraping the side of the
<em>Wanderer</em>. Fortunately, the sea was smooth, or
the maneuver would have been impossible of execution.
As it was, however, on the easy swell
that was running it was made with comparatively
small difficulty.
</p>
<p>
“Well, great Cæsar’s ghost!” blurted out a
stout, blond man in yachting costume, who occupied,
apparently, the position of owner of the
yacht, “if this isn’t the twentieth century with
a vengeance. Just think of it, Griggs—rescued
by an aëroplane!”
</p>
<p>
The man addressed, a good-natured-looking
man, almost as corpulent as the first speaker,
nodded appreciatively.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t really know how to thank you
folks,” continued the stout man; “we haven’t
much longer to stay above water, as you see. We
hit a derelict at dusk, and stove in our port bow.
The water came rushing in so fast that I had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
barely time to flash that wireless that you so
providentially caught.”
</p>
<p>
“It was feeble enough, I can tell you,” Frank
assured him; “fortunately, we were not far off,
and so managed to catch your appeal for help.”
</p>
<p>
The stout man was again warmly thanking
his rescuers, when Dr. Perkins interrupted.
</p>
<p>
“Suppose you come on board,” he said; “by
the looks of your craft she is likely to take a
plunge at any minute. I’d like to be able to cut
loose from her before that happens.”
</p>
<p>
Taking this hint, the stout man clambered on
board the <em>Sea Eagle</em> with more agility than might
have been expected from a man of his heavy
build. This done he extended a hand to his
friend, and then came the turn of the third occupant
of the cabin roof to disembark. This third
man was evidently, from his costume, a paid
hand on board the <em>Sea Eagle</em>. He was slight and
dark and foreign looking, with beady black eyes,
and a not over-prominent chin.
</p>
<p>
Directly all were on board, Dr. Perkins ordered Frank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
to “cast off” from the sinking yacht.
It was well this order was obeyed promptly, for
hardly had the <em>Sea Eagle</em> been disengaged from
the other craft’s side, than the <em>Wanderer</em> gave
a sudden plunge, bow downward, under the
waves. For one instant her stern upreared itself
vertically, showing the rudder and propeller,
and then, as if by magic, the whole craft vanished,
to find a grave in the ocean bed.
</p>
<p>
All this was seen by the searchlight, which Dr.
Perkins had kept concentrated on the yacht while
the last act of this ocean drama was being consummated.
As the yacht vanished a deep sigh
broke from the stout man.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by, poor old <em>Wanderer</em>,” he said,
“there’s an end of this cruise.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry that she was not in a condition to
tow to Brig Island,” remarked Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“My dear sir, so far as the actual monetary
loss is concerned it was fully covered by insurance,”
responded the stout man; “my only regret
is to see a craft I was very fond of end her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
days in such a fashion. Also, I am afraid my
friend Griggs here will be disappointed at the
failure of our cruise.”
</p>
<p>
“Good heavens!” cried Mr. Griggs, who appeared
to be a highly nervous individual, “I’m
glad to have my life, Sterrett—glad to have my
life. If I don’t catch my death of cold over this
I’ll be fortunate indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“In the meantime,” struck in the man addressed
as Sterrett, “we are forgetting in our
own troubles the debt of gratitude we owe to
our friends here. In the first place, let me introduce
ourselves. I am Paul Sterrett, late
owner of the <em>Wanderer</em>. This is my friend,
Samuel Griggs, and yonder,” indicating the foreign-looking
third man, “is Francis Le Blanc,
our cook and general handy man. We left New
York on a cruise up the coast sometime ago, and
up till to-night experienced no mishaps. However,
as my friend says, we must not repine; we
should consider ourselves fortunate indeed to
be onboard your remarkable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
craft instead of being in a watery grave, as we must have been had
it not been for your opportune arrival.”
</p>
<p>
“We consider ourselves fortunate to have been
of service to you,” responded the inventor, and
then went on in his turn to introduce himself and
his party, and also give a brief explanation of
the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, which had, as may be imagined,
excited the liveliest curiosity on the part of the
rescued castaways.
</p>
<p>
“But as we shall now get under way without
further loss of time,” he concluded, “you will be
able to see for yourselves just how the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
is controlled, and what she can do.”
</p>
<p>
As he finished this speech, Dr. Perkins extinguished
the searchlight, which had still been playing
on the oil-streaked waters which marked the
burial spot of the ill-fated <em>Wanderer</em>. This
done, he gave Frank the “come ahead” signal.
Obediently, as usual, the motor began its song,
and the propellers took up the whirring, buzzing
refrain. Mr. Sterrett and his companions sat
perfectly still in the positions in the stern which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
had been assigned to them. Had it been light
enough to read the expressions on their faces
one would have said that they were absolutely
dumbfounded.
</p>
<p>
Of course both Mr. Sterrett and his friends—as
well informed men—knew the wonderful
capabilities of the modern aëroplane. They had
witnessed many flights, and in common with
the generality of progressive Americans, knew
the general principles of aërial locomotion. But
when the <em>Sea Eagle</em> from a “boat” turned suddenly
into a hydroplane, they exchanged swift
expressions of the utmost astonishment. Only
their companion, the paid “hand” from the yacht,
sat sullenly unimpressed. In fact, since he had
boarded the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, he had not uttered a
syllable, only mumbling his thanks when Mr.
Sterrett and his companion had finished expressing
their gratitude for their rescue.
</p>
<p>
Under the skillful guidance of Dr. Perkins,
and the constant attention that Frank paid to
the whirring motor, the <em>Sea Eagle</em> made a quick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
run back to the island, being guided, when she
was still some distance away, by the ruddy glare
of a big beacon fire lighted by Ben Stubbs. It
was an instance of the veteran adventurer’s
thoughtfulness and resource that he had thought
of doing this, for in the hurry of the departure,
no such instructions had been given him. But
on his own responsibility he had kindled the blaze
which materially aided the swift return of the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> to her eyrie.
</p>
<p>
Reaching the island, the aërial wonder was
sent swinging in decreasing circles, till Dr. Perkins
was sure of a safe drop to the workshop on
the summit of the little spot of land, and then,
with a breath-catching rapidity, the helmsman
sent his wonderful vessel earthward, bringing it
to a stop within the ruddy glow caused by the
blazing bonfire which had guided them.
</p>
<p>
As the <em>Sea Eagle</em> settled to the earth the party
that had been left behind on the adventurous
night flight pressed to the side of the novel craft.
A glance showed them that the mission of Dr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
Perkins’ craft had been crowned with success,
and Billy and Pudge began plying the returned
voyagers with eager questions. Ben Stubbs was
slightly in the background, and it was not till
Mr. Sterrett and his companions had stepped out
on to the ground that he got a good look at them.
</p>
<p>
When he did, he gave a deep-drawn gasp of
surprise. An expression of supreme amazement
overspread his weather-beaten countenance. But
his eyes did not fix on Mr. Sterrett or his companion,
Griggs. Instead they traveled beyond
the nattily clad yachtsmen and rested on the slim
figure of the paid “hand.”
</p>
<p>
“Raoul Duval, as sure as there’s a north star!”
choked out Ben, half to himself, “waal, if this
ain’t a small bit of a world!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV.—BEN’S PLAN STOLEN.</h2>
<p>
For his part Duval was no less quick in recognizing
Ben Stubbs. At the moment, Dr. Perkins
and the rest were standing in a group a
little apart, and discussing their adventure, while
Mr. Sterrett was loud in his praises of the <em>Sea
Eagle</em>, which he described as the most wonderful
craft on earth. Giving a swift look round to see
that he was unobserved, Duval pressed a finger
to his lips to enjoin silence on Ben, and then
beckoned him to come a short distance out of the
firelight.
</p>
<p>
Ben, in wonderment as to this unexpected reappearance
of the young man who had exercised
such sharp practice on him, obeyed the summons.
But when he addressed Duval it was in an angry
tone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s this mean,” he exclaimed, “how did
you come here?”
</p>
<p>
“As you see, by that air ship,” was the reply;
“I never expected to see you here, however. I
tell you, Stubbs, I’ve had a lot of hard luck.
When those boys and that professor-chap rescued
us I had been compelled to ship as a deckhand
and cook on that yacht. Just think of it.”
</p>
<p>
“A mighty good thing for you, say I,” grunted
Ben brusquely, “a little good, honest, hard work
will take some of the crooked kinks out of your
brain. My recommendation to you, Duval, is
to stick to that sort of a job, and in time you’ll
learn to be a man.”
</p>
<p>
Duval shot a look full of malice at the blunt
old fellow. But his face was in the shadow, and
Ben did not notice it. Instead he continued:
</p>
<p>
“But I ain’t the one to bear a grudge, Duval,
although you did come mighty near shipwrecking
my faith in human natur’. Shake hands,
mate, and for your old father’s sake I’ll do what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
I can fer you. I ain’t one to kick a man when
he’s down.”
</p>
<p>
Duval extended his thin, long-fingered hand,
and Ben seized it in his rough paw and shook it
with a heartiness that made the dark-skinned
Duval flinch.
</p>
<p>
“There!” exclaimed the old fellow heartily, as
he relinquished his grip, “that’s all ship-shape
and in good trim. Now let’s get back to the rest
of ’em afore they see us talking apart.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re not going to give me away to them?”
asked Duval, almost breathlessly. “Sterrett
thinks I’m all right, and may give me a better
job some time.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t stand in your way, lad,” heartily rejoined
Ben. “In fact, I’d like to help you get on
your feet again.”
</p>
<p>
“How about that plan of the location of the
<em>Belle of New Orleans</em>?” asked Duval, without
paying any attention to Ben’s last remarks.
</p>
<p>
“Safe enough in my pocket, mate,” replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
Ben, tapping his worn coat; “why do you want
to know?”
</p>
<p>
“I wondered if you had investigated my
story.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I haven’t yet; but I don’t mind telling
you that I may do so before very long. And I’ll
tell you right now, Duval, that if we recover
anything valuable from that wreck I’ll see to it
that you get a good share of it, and then you can
set up in business again and make a new start.”
</p>
<p>
Duval expressed what appeared to be very
deep thanks for Ben’s generosity. But, in reality,
his thoughts were busy elsewhere. An idea
had come into his head that was to bear strange
fruit before very long. They joined the group
clustered about Dr. Perkins without their absence
having been noticed. Billy and Pudge
had seen to it while the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was on
her mission of rescue that a good hot lunch
should be ready on the return of the expedition.
A few moments after Ben and Duval joined
the others Pudge announced this fact, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
party trooped into the hut, nothing loath, to fall
to with hearty appetites on a good meal. Soon
after they “turned in,” the boys insisting on the
strangers taking their bunks, while they and Ben
Stubbs put up with “shake-downs” on the floor.
</p>
<p>
It was very late—or rather early morning—when
they retired, and before long all were
wrapped in the deep sleep of exhaustion. Ben
was the first to awaken, to find the sun streaming
into the hut.
</p>
<p>
“Great guns!” he exclaimed, glancing at
Billy’s alarm clock on a shelf, “it’s after seven.”
</p>
<p>
Broad awake in a jiffy, he aroused the others,
going from the floor sleepers to the bunks. Dr.
Perkins, Mr. Sterrett and the latter’s friend were
awakened in turn, and it was not till then that
Ben noticed that Duval’s bunk was empty.
</p>
<p>
“Good fer him,” he said to himself warmly,
“the young chap has started to turn over a new
leaf by gittin’ out early. I’ll take a turn outside
afore breakfast and see if I can find him.”
</p>
<p>
But Duval was not about the workshop, nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
did Ben’s calls summon him to breakfast. It
was not till that instant that an ugly suspicion
flashed into Ben’s hitherto unsuspecting mind.
Without saying a word to the others he hastily
drew out his wallet and, withdrawing to a corner
of the hut, examined its contents. Instantly his
suspicions were verified.
</p>
<p>
The plan of the location of the wreck of the
<em>Belle of New Orleans</em> was missing!
</p>
<p>
Stifling his anger as well as he could, Ben hastened
to the beach. As he had suspected the
moment he found the plan missing, the small
skiff was gone. What had happened was as
plain as print to Ben now. Young Duval had
waited till all in the hut were asleep, then he
had stealthily crept from his bunk, recovered the
plan he had given to Ben, and had decamped in
the small boat.
</p>
<p>
“Waal, the dern scallywag!” burst out Ben, as
he stood on the beach in the first shock of his
discovery.
</p>
<p>
In his anger he shook his fist at the strip of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
sea between the island and the mainland to which,
he did not doubt, Duval had crossed in his flight.
</p>
<p>
“The—the—precious scamp!” he continued,
his bronzed features working, “and I trusted him
as I would have trusted his dad.”
</p>
<p>
Shaking his head, Ben slowly made his way
from the beach back to the hut. He said nothing
of his discovery during breakfast, but after
the meal he found a pretext for drawing Dr.
Perkins to one side. To him he communicated
what had occurred.
</p>
<p>
“A good riddance of bad rubbish,” said Dr.
Perkins when Ben, whose voice shook with anger,
had concluded his story; “we are cheaply
rid of him, Ben.”
</p>
<p>
The inventor, while not a selfish man, was
so wrapped up in the success of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
that, to him, the loss of the plan of the wreck
did not appeal in the same way that it did to
Ben Stubbs. But the old adventurer took him up
indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“Bad rubbish, as you say, sir,” he grated out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
“but if that paper hadn’t bin worth something
Duval wouldn’t have taken it. It’s good-by to
recovering that stuff from the <em>Belle of New Orleans</em>
now.”
</p>
<p>
“By Jove! I’d quite forgotten my promise to
you,” said Dr. Perkins contritely; “but never
fear, Ben, I’ll see that you are not a loser.”
</p>
<p>
“It ain’t that,” rejoined Ben; “I don’t give a
snap for the plan; but it’s the ingratitood of that
young whippersnapper that’s got me sore. I’d
like—I’d like to find that wreck just to get ahead
of him.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” rejoined the inventor, “I understand
your feelings. He has certainly treated
you very badly. But possibly we can think up
some way to outgeneral him.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t see how we are goin’ to do it without
that plan,” rejoined Ben; “but I ain’t one to cry
over spilt milk. It’s gone, and that’s all there is
to it. The best thing to do is to forget it.”
</p>
<p>
Frank and Harry, on their way to the <em>Sea
Eagle’s</em> shelter, were passing at the moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
After asking the inventor if he thought it would
be advisable, and receiving an affirmative reply,
Ben called them over. As briefly as he could he
told them what had happened.
</p>
<p>
“Well, the precious rascal!” broke out Frank;
“I thought there was something snaky-looking
about the chap last night. Isn’t there a chance
of catching him?”
</p>
<p>
“Not such a slick rascal as he is, Frank,” rejoined
Ben despondently; “no, the plan is gone,
and gone for good—so good-by to that.”
</p>
<p>
But Harry now spoke up, and to the astonishment
of the others his voice did not hold a trace
of the disappointment they could not help but
feel.
</p>
<p>
“Cheer up, Ben,” he said heartily, “and by the
way you might just cast your eye over this and
see if it looks familiar.”
</p>
<p>
As he spoke he dipped a hand into his breast
pocket and produced a folded paper. Ben, with
a mystified expression, took it and opened the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
thing up. The next instant it almost fell from
his hands.
</p>
<p>
“Why!—why, by the glittering Pole Star!” he
choked out, “it’s the plan itself!”
</p>
<p>
“Not exactly,” laughed Harry, “but I think
it’s a pretty good copy. You see I always liked
drawing and that sort of thing, so when you
showed me that plan I memorized it, and when I
got a chance I sketched out this copy in case
anything happened to the original. I think it’s
good enough to take a chance on.”
</p>
<p>
“Good enough!” roared Ben, “why, lad, it’s
the plan itself. Now, then, if we don’t beat Master
Duval to the <em>Belle of New Orleans</em> call me
a double-decked, lee-scuppered sea cook!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV.—WHAT HAPPENED ASHORE.</h2>
<p>
As Ben had surmised, Duval had waited till
the boys and their friends were sound asleep, and
had then, in accordance with a plan he had
thought of the instant he set eyes on his kind-hearted
friend, sneaked out of his bunk and, tip-toeing
softly to Ben’s clothes, located the
wallet and with small trouble or loss of time
abstracted the plan of the lost wreck. During
the evening the ingrate had heard a description
of the island given to Mr. Sterrett by Dr. Perkins,
so that after taking the plan he left the hut
and made for the beach by the path through the
woods.
</p>
<p>
Shoving off the skiff, he had taken up the oars
and started rowing as fast as he could for the
mainland. But what with the darkness and his
unfamiliarity with that part of the coast, he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
failed to land in the cove adjoining the fisher
village of Motthaven, and had beached his craft
a considerable distance to the south of the place.
It was just growing light when the bow of the
skiff grated on the sand, and Duval hastily
scrambled out and started off. His object was
to find a railroad station and travel as far as his
scant supply of money would take him from the
vicinity of Brig Island.
</p>
<p>
After that his plans were still vague; but he
had an indefinite idea of getting to New York
or some large town, and interesting anybody
with capital to finance an expedition for the recovery
of the gold dust chest and the bag of
black pearls that lay at the bottom of the Black
Bayou amid the moldering timbers of the lost
steamer. The utter depravity and black-heartedness
of this plan, and his base ingratitude to
the man who had aided him in every way, did
not strike him. Instead, there was but one over-mastering
thought in his mind, and that was to
secure whatever treasure might be in the wreck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
as quickly as possible, and then vanish from
America for some foreign country with his ill-gotten
wealth.
</p>
<p>
Busy with such thoughts as these, he hastened
up the beach in the gray of the dawn, and finding
a rough sort of path leading up the low cliff
that overhung the beach, he started to ascend it.
He had not gone more than a few paces, however,
before he saw, buried back in some trees, a
rough-looking hut.
</p>
<p>
Duval was hungry and thirsty, and, moreover,
his long row, at such a feverish pace, had exhausted
him. Determining to tell a story that
would account for his presence in that isolated
part of the coast at such an early hour, he made
up his mind to apply at the hut for some refreshment.
His story was to be that he had set
off on a fishing expedition and had lost his way
and been wandering all night.
</p>
<p>
“Probably only some fool fisherman lives there
who will believe anything I choose to tell him,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
he thought; “these fellows are all as thick as
mud, anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
Musing to himself in this fashion, the renegade
fellow made his way toward the hut and,
coming to the door, knocked loudly on it. But
there was no answer, and when, after repeated
knockings, he could elicit no response, Duval
determined that, as there appeared to be nobody
at home, he would walk in uninvited and see
what he could “forage” for himself.
</p>
<p>
The door was unlocked; in fact, it had no latch
and hung crazily on its rusty hinges. Opening
it, Duval found himself in an interior as rough
and uncouth as the outside of the hut had promised.
A table made of old planks, seemingly
flotsam from the beach, two soap boxes for
chairs, and a rough sort of bunk, or rather shelf,
littered with a pile of dirty old blankets, made
up the furnishings. On the table were the remains
of a meal, which had consisted apparently
of roasted lobsters and fish. Two tin cups and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
tin plates, with battered knives and forks beside
them, completed the table service.
</p>
<p>
“Confound it all,” muttered Duval, “whoever
lives here is as poor as a church mouse. Some
miserable fisherman, I suppose, who has hardly
enough to keep body and soul together.”
</p>
<p>
He walked to a corner of the shack where there
was a sort of cupboard contrived out of old
boxes. He had guessed that this formed the
pantry of the establishment. Sure enough, in it
he found a loaf half consumed, and the remains
of a roasted lobster, as well as some scraps of
fish. He was too hungry to be particular and
was just about to start eating when a quick step
behind him caused him to start violently, dropping
the food he had in his hand.
</p>
<p>
But before he could utter a word the young
man—or, rather, loutish boy—who had entered
so quietly, owing to his being barefooted, stepped
up to him and, raising a heavy oar he carried,
dealt the intruder a blow that deprived him of
his senses for the time being.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
</p>
<p>
As Duval fell to the floor a man in rough
fisherman’s garb, with a wrinkled, mahogany-tinged
face and a tuft of gray whisker on his
prominent chin, entered.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Zeb, what’s up?” he exclaimed, in an
astonished voice.
</p>
<p>
“I found this feller snoopin’ about in here,
pop,” was the rejoinder, “an’ I calkelated ter
lay him out till we could find out what his business
was.”
</p>
<p>
“Good ernuff, boy,” responded the elder Daniels,
for most of our readers must be aware by
this time of the identity of the two newcomers;
“but who do yer suppose he is? He’s dressed
like one of them fancy sailors off’n a yacht.”
</p>
<p>
“Dad, I figger he’s a detective sent here by
them kids on Brig Island. That’s the way it
looks to me.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you’re right, Zeb. Here, give me a
hand to get him up on the bunk. By hickory,
but you must have hit him a clip.”
</p>
<p>
“Reckon I did land kind er hard on him, dad,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
but I wasn’t takin’ chances of his turning on
me.”
</p>
<p>
The two worthies lifted Duval’s limp form
and laid it, not over-gently, on the tumbled pile
of frowsy blankets. This done, a sudden thought
struck the elder Daniels.
</p>
<p>
“Calkerlate I’ll take a look through his
pockets,” he said; “might rummage out something
worth havin’.”
</p>
<p>
Zeb helped his father in this task; but aside
from a small sum of money, and a collection of
worthless odds and ends, they found nothing
that appeared to them to be of importance. In
an inner pocket Zeb came across the stolen map.
Much mystified, he showed it to his father.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think this kin be, pop?” he inquired.
</p>
<p>
The old man took it and knitted his brow over
the document in a puzzled fashion.
</p>
<p>
“By hickory, I kain’t make it out,” he confessed;
“thar’s some riting in ther corner,
though. Spell it out, Zeb.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
Zeb, obediently, but somewhat laboriously,
read out:
</p>
<p>
“‘Map of the location of the wreck of the
<em>Belle of New Orleans</em>.’ That’s what it says; but
what does it mean?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s plain enough, ain’t it?” retorted the
old man. “It’s a map of some wreck or other,
but what does this feller want with it? That’s
the question.”
</p>
<p>
“Better ask him. He’s opening his eyes and
coming to.”
</p>
<p>
Sure enough Duval stirred uneasily, and threw
up his hand as if to ward off a blow.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t hit me, Frank Chester,” he cried out;
“I’ll give back the plan I stole.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh-ho! That’s the way the wind blows, is
it?” muttered the elder Daniels, and then, addressing
Duval, who was now staring wildly
about him, he said:
</p>
<p>
“So you come from Brig Island, eh, my
hearty?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but how did I get here? Oh, I remember now. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
was looking for food and somebody
struck me.”
</p>
<p>
“That was me, I reckon,” grinned Zeb, “who
are you, anyhow? Did those kids on Brig Island
send you here after us?”
</p>
<p>
What with the effects of his blow, and his
alarm at his position, Duval lost his customary
caution.
</p>
<p>
“I’m no friend of anybody on Brig Island,” he
exclaimed, “but what do you know about that
place, anyhow?”
</p>
<p>
“A whole lot,” grimly rejoined the elder Daniels;
“now, see here, my lad, you’d best make a
clean breast of it. How did you come by this
plan?”
</p>
<p>
The old fisherman, who was pretty keen-minded,
had guessed by Duval’s guilty manner
that there was some mystery connected with the
document which he now flourished.
</p>
<p>
Duval sat up on the bunk and pleaded for the
return of the plan; but to no avail.
</p>
<p>
“I’m smart enough to see through a wall when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
there’s a hole in it,” said old Daniels; “now, see
here, I reckon you ain’t no friend of them kids
on the island?”
</p>
<p>
Duval shook his head. He had, of course, no
reason to dislike the boys; but he was an arrant
coward at heart, and saw that the men in whose
power he was, hated the young dwellers on Brig
Island. He therefore thought it good policy to
affect to be of their way of thinking.
</p>
<p>
“I’m no friend of theirs,” he said, rather sullenly,
“but what’s that to you?”
</p>
<p>
“May be a whole lot, if this plan is what I
think it is. Now I’ve a pretty good idea that
you come by it in no very honest way. Ain’t
that so?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I was given it,” stammered Duval uneasily,
while Zenas’ little gimlet-like gray eyes
bored him through.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a lie,” rejoined Daniels easily; “come
on, out with the truth, now. It won’t do you no
harm, and may keep you from the constables.”
</p>
<p>
This was a shrewd move on Daniels’ part.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
Duval’s eyes dilated with fear at the idea of
coming within the reach of the law. Without
more ado he blurted out part of the story of the
lost <em>Belle of New Orleans</em>, and offered to let Zenas
share in the prize if he should locate it.
While Duval was talking the elder Daniels had
leaned forward, consumed with interest. Avaricious
to a degree, the thought of the sunken
treasure made him fairly burn with desire to
gain it.
</p>
<p>
“You’re sure that was a true story that feller
give you?” he asked, as Duval concluded his
story.
</p>
<p>
“I’m certain of it. I know for a fact that my
father had a lot of gold dust and those black
pearls with him on his last voyage, for he had
written home about the fortune that he was
bringing.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! Waal, your story sounds all right,
and I don’t know but what you’ve come to the
right shop to get some one to help you get at the
wreck. I’ve got a diving outfit and a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
money, and I kin raise some more. Now sit
down and Zeb will get you a bite to eat, and
we’ll talk things over.”
</p>
<p>
And thus was begun an alliance which was to
prove a source of much trouble to the Boy Aviators
and their friends in the near future.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI.—OFF ON THE “AIR ROUTE.”</h2>
<p>
In the meantime indignation was at white heat
on Brig Island. Mr. Sterrett was for advertising
the disappearance of Duval, and offering a
reward for his apprehension. He confessed that
he had not liked the man’s looks, but had shipped
him as help was hard to get at the time. Dr.
Perkins agreed that it might not be a bad idea
to communicate at once with the authorities and
try to have the rascal captured.
</p>
<p>
“But,” he added, “I am afraid he is too clever
a scamp to fall into the clutches of the law very
easily.”
</p>
<p>
“I am of that opinion, too,” frankly admitted
Mr. Sterrett, “but it will do no harm to do all
we can to place him where he belongs.”
</p>
<p>
To get ashore Frank had first to swim off to
the motor boat, for the skiff, as we know, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
vanished. He then ran the engine-driven craft
in alongside some rocks that sloped down into
deep water, and from that elevation the party
embarked. A quick run was made to Motthaven,
from whence a description of Duval was wired
to the metropolitan police, and the local authorities
urged out of their usual lethargy by promises
of a reward if Duval was found. Late that
afternoon the search yielded results in the finding
of the abandoned skiff, and the discovery of
the hut in which the Daniels had been living
since the boys had instituted proceedings against
them.
</p>
<p>
Some evidences of a hasty departure were
found, but no clews that would give any idea of
whither the fugitives had proceeded. In fact it
was only by piecing together some scraps of torn
paper that it was discovered that the hut had
been used by the Daniels as a refuge.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Dr. Perkins that evening, after
they had bidden good-by to Mr. Sterrett and his
friend, who had returned to New York, “well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
in my opinion the less time we lose in getting to
Black Bayou the better it will be, for, to my mind,
there is little doubt that Duval means to forestall
our friend, Ben Stubbs, in ransacking the
wreck.”
</p>
<p>
The others agreed that this seemed highly
probable, and Dr. Perkins made immediate arrangements
for a caretaker to occupy quarters
on Brig Island during their absence. This done,
a return was made to the little settlement, and
the next day final preparations were made for
the adventurous trip through the air. The <em>Sea
Eagle</em> was provisioned, and a light wireless apparatus
installed, the stay wires being used as
aërials. Of course the instruments were not so
strong as those used at the shore station, but it
was calculated that they had a capacity of about
twenty miles over land, and forty above the sea,
depending, of course, a good deal on the wave
adjustment and the weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
Twenty-four hours after the adventurers had
started work on the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, the craft was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
ready for her dash. Ben Stubbs, Pudge Perkins
and Billy Barnes were to go to New Orleans,
there to await the arrival of the party.
Their departure took place amid regretful wails
from Pudge, who loudly declaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Aërials and ant-hills! I don’t see why we
can’t go by the <em>Sea Eagle</em>.”
</p>
<p>
But Dr. Perkins’ word was law and he had
decided that the fewer persons who took part in
the test the better the chance of success would
be, and as Frank and Harry were both experienced
aviators he placed great reliance in their
aid. The morning after the departure of the
New Orleans-bound passengers the caretaker
and his family arrived. They were honest folk
from the shore, who could be trusted to look
after the many valuable devices on the island,
and keep curiosity seekers off till the party returned.
For Dr. Perkins had decided to use Brig
Island as a permanent workshop, and expected,
if the <em>Sea Eagle</em> proved a success, to build many
craft like her and dispose of them at good prices.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
The working of the electric fence was explained
to the caretaker; but he declared:
</p>
<p>
“I reckon my old gun will do more to keep undesirables
off than any of them electric didoes.”
</p>
<p>
There was now nothing more to do, the caretaker
being duly installed, but to take to the air,
in what was, at that date, the most unique aërial
craft in existence. For the voyage, beside the
provisions and extra fuel and oil, life belts had
been provided, and not a detail had been overlooked.
It was seven o’clock on a fine, breathless
morning when Dr. Perkins gave the order,
“Start up the engines!”
</p>
<p>
A thrill shot through both Frank and Harry
at the words. Experienced in aërial adventure
as were both boys, they could not but feel that
they were embarking on the most adventurous
undertaking of their lives.
</p>
<p>
“We’re off!” cried Harry, as a quiver ran
through the craft, and the motor roared from its
exhausts, emitting clouds of mingled flame and
blue smoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes; off on a fight for fame and fortune!”
cried Frank, as Dr. Perkins threw in the clutch;
and, with her propellers beating the air so rapidly
that they were a mere blur, the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
shot skyward.
</p>
<p>
In half an hour’s time, to the watchers on the
island, the aërial craft had dwindled to a mere
dot in the distant sky, and five minutes later she
vanished from view. The boys gave many backward
looks as they winged away from Brig Island.
Despite their adventures, they had spent
many pleasant days there, and it appeared to
them to be almost a second home. Of all that
they were to experience before returning to the
island they little dreamed at the moment, but
their hearts beat high with exultation as the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> winged her way southward at forty miles
an hour, and about five hundred feet above the
ocean.
</p>
<p>
They had been in the air about an hour
when they encountered a situation which may
become common enough before many years have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
passed, but which was an exciting novelty to
them. Off on the horizon a liner was sighted,
steaming toward the American coast. Before
long they made her out to be a big, two-funneled
craft, painted black, and with numerous
decks rising above her shapely hull.
</p>
<p>
“One of the transatlantic liners that make
Portland their terminal,” decided Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“Shall I wireless them?” said Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, do so. It will be an interesting experiment,
and besides will show how the apparatus
will work.”
</p>
<p>
Harry lost no time in getting to work. After
a brief interval he “raised” the operator on the
liner, Dr. Perkins keeping the <em>Sea Eagle</em> swinging
in big, lazy circles while he did so.
</p>
<p>
“We sighted you from the bridge half an
hour ago,” flashed the operator, “who and what
are you?”
</p>
<p>
“The hydro-aëroplane <em>Sea Eagle</em>, bound from
Maine for New Orleans. Who are you?” flashed
back Harry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
“The <em>Ultonia</em>, of the Portland and Liverpool
line, eight days out from England,” was the
rejoinder; “have you got any American newspapers
on board?”
</p>
<p>
Now it happened that Dr. Perkins had brought
some papers of the day before along in his
pockets, and at Harry’s request he handed them
to him.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“I was going to suggest that we dive across
the <em>Ultonia</em> and deliver the papers,” said Harry;
“can we do it, doctor?”
</p>
<p>
“By all means,” rejoined Dr. Perkins, deeply
interested; “flash them a message of what we
intend to do so that they may be prepared.”
</p>
<p>
Harry sent out the message and the operator
flashed back a quick “Thanks,” adding the next
moment: “Good-by. I’m going to beat it out
on deck and watch you.”
</p>
<p>
Frank, in the meantime, had done the papers
up in a compact bundle and weighted them with
an empty beef can.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
</p>
<p>
“All ready?” cried Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“All ready, sir,” was the prompt reply from
the boys.
</p>
<p>
“Then hold tight. I’m going to make a swift
dive.”
</p>
<p>
The liner was now almost directly underneath
the soaring <em>Sea Eagle</em>. Her rails were black
with passengers craning their necks upward at
the great, man-made bird. From her funnels
poured clouds of inky smoke, while her sharp
prow cut the water on each side of her bow into
sparkling foam. On the bridge were uniformed
officers, pointing binoculars and spy glasses aloft,
for the operator had communicated the news of
what the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was about to do.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the watching throngs of ocean travelers
saw the <em>Sea Eagle</em> poise in air like a hawk
about to pounce. Then down she came, cleaving
the air like a falling stone.
</p>
<p>
A great cry went up from the packed decks.
It seemed as if the air craft must perish, that
nothing could check her fall, and that she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
doomed to plunge headlong into the sea. But
in a flash the cry changed to a mighty cheer.
</p>
<p>
Less than forty feet from the water the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> was seen to shoot upward and straight
toward the steamer. Like an arrow from a bow
the great aërial craft shot whizzing above the
liner’s bridge, and under the wireless aërials extending
from mast to mast. Just as she roared
by above the officers’ heads, like some antedeluvian
thunder-lizard, something was seen to fall
downward and land on the top of the charthouse.
It was the bundle of papers thrown by
Harry. A sailor scrambled up and got them,
while the crowded decks yelled themselves hoarse.
</p>
<p>
Then the <em>Sea Eagle</em> soared up high above the
mast tips, and Harry seated himself at the wireless
once more. Presently to his ears came a
message from the speeding liner far below.
</p>
<p>
“Captain Seabury wishes to congratulate you
on the most wonderful feat of the century.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII.—AN AËRIAL AMBULANCE.</h2>
<p>
Harry was about to flash back an answer to
the message of congratulation when, suddenly,
into the scene of triumph was injected a grim
note of threatened tragedy. One of the passengers,
a young woman who had been leaning far
out over the rail of the boat deck waving a handkerchief
of filmy lace and linen, was seen, all
at once, to topple from her perch.
</p>
<p>
The next instant, and while her shrill scream
for help still rent the air, a young man who
had been standing beside her jumped out into
space without waiting to do more than strip off
coat and shoes. The <em>Ultonia</em> was speeding ahead
at the fastest gait her twin screws were capable
of. She was a large vessel, probably some 15,000
tons of registration, and her momentum was too
great to stop her for a considerable distance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p>
From the <em>Sea Eagle</em> horrified eyes saw the accident,
and witnessed the young woman’s head
bob up for an instant amid the frothy wake of
the big craft. The liner’s whistle screamed out
a shrill alarm, and men could be seen scampering
to lower a boat, while life buoys were thrown
overboard.
</p>
<p>
But before anything more could be done the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> took a sudden swoop, a swift dive
downward, characteristic of the bird for which
she had been named.
</p>
<p>
The wonderful craft struck the water with a
force that sent a cloud of spray boiling up about
her, temporarily hiding her substructure and her
occupants from view.
</p>
<p>
“She’s sunk!” went up a moaning cry from the
decks of the liner. But, no! An instant later it
was seen that the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, an aëroplane no
longer but a winged boat, was speeding as fast
as her twin propellers could drive her toward
the spot where the young woman had last been
seen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
Hardly a word, except Dr. Perkins’ caution to
“hang on tight,” had been exchanged between the
aviators from their simultaneous observation of
the accident till the moment the <em>Sea Eagle</em> struck
the water. But now orders came quick and fast.
</p>
<p>
“Attend to the engines!”
</p>
<p>
The order came from Frank, and Harry
sprang into the place his brother vacated.
</p>
<p>
Frank hastily buckled on one of the life jackets
and then, as the <em>Sea Eagle</em> skimmed the water
at a twenty-five knot gait, he scanned the seething
lane of foam behind the liner. Suddenly he
saw what he was looking for. A white, imploring
face, crowned with a wealth of golden hair.
</p>
<p>
“Save me!” screamed the girl who, although
she had been swimming, was by this time too
exhausted with the effects of her immersion and
the weight of her water-soaked clothes, to keep
up any longer. Without an instant’s hesitation,
Frank leaped into the water and began striking
out with powerful strokes for the sinking girl.
He reached her side just as she was going down
for the third time.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<span class='caption'>WITHOUT AN INSTANT’S HESITATION, FRANK LEAPED INTO THE WATER.</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>
In the meantime the young man who had
sprung after her had also become exhausted, and
would certainly have sunk had not Dr. Perkins
headed the <em>Sea Eagle</em> in his direction. Leaning
far out as they came alongside the struggling
man, Harry grasped him by the collar, and then
half dragged him into the hydroplane portion of
the air craft. This done, full speed was made
for Frank and the young woman.
</p>
<p>
None too soon did they reach Frank’s side.
With the blind instinct of a drowning person the
young woman was clinging so tightly to Frank
that, strong swimmer though he was, he had
much difficulty in keeping above the water. Dr.
Perkins ordered the motor stopped as they neared
the two, and allowed the <em>Sea Eagle</em> to glide up
to them. Then both he and Harry bent all their
strength to hauling on board, first the young
woman and then Frank.
</p>
<p>
By this time the liner’s speed had been checked,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
and her officers were swinging her in a broad
circle to the scene of the accident. A boat had
been lowered and was heading for the <em>Sea Eagle</em>,
but Dr. Perkins, snatching up the megaphone,
hailed the oarsman and told them that everything
was all right.
</p>
<p>
This done, power was applied once more, and
the <em>Sea Eagle</em> headed for the liner’s side. As
if guessing his intention a gangway had been
lowered, and all was ready for their reception as
they came alongside. In the meantime the young
man had introduced the golden-haired young
woman as his bride, and himself as Stanley Travers,
of Portland, Me. To say that both he and
Mrs. Travers were grateful would be not to
state one half of their actual feelings.
</p>
<p>
In fact, their expressions of appreciation took
so long that one of the officers at the head of
the gangway shouted:
</p>
<p>
“This is a mail boat and we must hurry,
please.”
</p>
<p>
While this was going on congratulations on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
the plucky act had been shouted down from the
uniformed skipper on the bridge and from a
score of the passengers that banked the rails
three and four deep.
</p>
<p>
At last Mr. and Mrs. Travers, wet to the skin,
clambered up the liner’s tall, black side, and the
boat was hauled up on the davits. As the big
craft, dipping her ensign and blowing her siren,
heaved ahead, a shout of enthusiasm went up.
But it was drowned by the roar of the <em>Sea
Eagle’s</em> motor. Hardly had the propellers of the
vessel begun to churn the water once more before
Dr. Perkins’ craft rose from the water like
a white-winged sea gull after a refreshing dip.
As the gallant sea-and-air ship rose, her three
occupants waved their hands in farewell in rejoinder
to the babel of shouts beneath them.
</p>
<p>
“Well, at any rate, if the <em>Sea Eagle</em> never
does anything more,” remarked Dr. Perkins, “she
has accomplished a great deal.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think so,” exclaimed Frank, who
had slipped into dry clothes as soon as the <em>Sea</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
<em>Eagle</em> took the air once more; “it isn’t every
craft that finds her baptism in life-saving at
sea.”
</p>
<p>
As long as they could see the <em>Ultonia</em> the big
liner continued to blow her whistle, and doubtless
the eyes of all her passengers remained fixed
attentively on the wonderful sky ship as she
waxed smaller and smaller against the blue.
That afternoon the voyagers found themselves
off Cape Ann. High above the cape they flew,
cutting off a good chunk of distance in this way.
The folks in West Gloucester stared in wonderment
as the huge air ship soared by high above
the town, and when a short time later the aviators
passed above the white-winged fishing fleet,
every tin pan and fog horn in the flotilla of small
craft sounded an enthusiastic “God speed” to
the air travelers.
</p>
<p>
Far behind the main body of the fisher craft
lagged a small sloop, and as the <em>Sea Eagle</em> came
closer to her the boys noticed that her flag was
flying from the peak “union down,” a sign of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
distress the world over. The big hydro-aëroplane
was flying low at the time, and it was easy
to see, without the aid of glasses, that several
men were running about the sloop’s decks and
shouting something up at the air voyagers.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we go down and see what the trouble
is?” asked Frank, as he and Harry saw the signs
of distress.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” decided the doctor, “no craft, either
of the air or of the sea, can disregard such a
signal of disaster. It will be odd if, for the
second time on the very first day of our cruise,
we are able to render aid to somebody who needs
it badly.”
</p>
<p>
The boys thought so, too, and as they dropped
seaward the minds of all three occupants of the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> were busy with speculations concerning
what could be the cause of the sloop’s distress.
Dr. Perkins caused his craft to alight
gently on the sea a short distance from the sloop,
and then headed her over the waves toward the
distressed vessel. As they drew closer they could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
see a grizzled-looking fellow, in rough fisher’s
garb, leaning over the side.
</p>
<p>
“Come quick!” he shouted, “there’s been bad
work going on aboard!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII.—AN ERRAND OF MERCY.</h2>
<p>
“What’s up?” cried Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, what’s the trouble?” came from Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“Trouble enough. We sprang a leak two days
ago, out on the fishing banks, and have been at
the pumps ever since. Now we’ve got the leak
stopped, but my mate, Joe Higgins, was struck
on the head by the boom and is so mortal bad
that if we don’t get a doctor for him pretty quick
I’m afraid he’ll die. Then, too, our provisions
is run out.”
</p>
<p>
While the man was reciting this catalogue of
mishaps the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was run alongside, and
Dr. Perkins made her fast with a line the man
flung to him.
</p>
<p>
“First let’s have a look at the injured man,”
he said and, without further delay, Captain Zebedee
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
Crooks, as he informed the travelers his
name was, led them aft to a tiny cabin, stuffy,
dark and reeking of fish. The boys followed
Dr. Perkins into this wretched little den and
Captain Zebedee lighted a sea lantern.
</p>
<p>
Its rays showed them a heavily built man of
middle age lying on a locker. His head was
bandaged, and although he breathed he showed
no other signs of life. Dr. Perkins, with the skill
of a professional man, made a hasty examination.
</p>
<p>
“This man is badly hurt,” he said at length.
“I am afraid his skull is fractured, but of that I
cannot be certain. He should be ashore in a hospital.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye! I know that,” rejoined Captain Zebedee,
“but at the rate we are going now we won’t
get ashore till to-morrow night, and by that time
poor Joe may be dead.”
</p>
<p>
“I think it extremely likely,” replied Dr. Perkins,
“but we must get him ashore at once.”
</p>
<p>
“What, in that sky schooner of yours?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
Dr. Perkins nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we must get him on deck without further
loss of time. Then we’ll rush him to a hospital.”
</p>
<p>
“The good Lord who sent you here bless you!”
exclaimed the rugged old fisherman, affected almost
to tears. “I never thought when I seen
you away up thar in ther sky that you’d bother
to notice the poor <em>Star of Gloucester</em>; but you
did. You come down from the clouds like so
many angels.”
</p>
<p>
“Funny-looking angels,” remarked Frank to
Harry, in an undertone. But Captain Zebedee’s
gratitude was so heartfelt and earnest that
neither of the boys could find it in them to smile
at his odd phrases.
</p>
<p>
Captain Zebedee summoned some of his crew
from the deck and as tenderly as possible the injured
man was conveyed from the cabin. This
done, he was lowered into the <em>Sea Eagle</em> and
laid on a pile of blankets already prepared for
his reception.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
</p>
<p>
“Better make for Bayhaven,” counseled Captain
Zebedee; “there’s a good hospital there, and
it lies right on the coast about in a straight line
from here.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins nodded, and then, having seen
that the injured man was in a position to endure
the ride comfortably, the flight to the shore was
begun; but not till a substantial amount of provisions
and some fresh water had been supplied
to the fishing smack. As the <em>Sea Eagle</em> took to
the air the <em>Star of Gloucester</em> was set before the
wind, and staggered off on her slow course once
more. The last the boys saw of the clumsy fisherman,
the stout figure of Captain Zebedee was
leaning on the stern bulwarks waving to them as
they winged shoreward.
</p>
<p>
The coast was a rocky one, with gaunt cliffs
and few habitations. But as they reached it and
flew low above a small house on the summit of
the cliffs, they spied a man at work in a small
garden. Of him Frank inquired the way to Bayhaven.
The man was too much astonished to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
answer at first, and stood looking stupidly up at
the winged monster above him.
</p>
<p>
But finally he collected his wits and pointed to
the south. The <em>Sea Eagle</em> was thereupon headed
round, and, not long after, her passengers came
in sight of a tiny town huddled in a cove almost
at the water’s edge. Heading out seaward once
more, Dr. Perkins dropped to the water in the
harbor, and then at reduced speed ran the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> up to the long wharf which jutted out
at the foot of the little city’s main street.
</p>
<p>
By the time they arrived alongside of the jetty
half the population of the town was on hand to
greet them. Their approach through the air had
been seen when they were still some distance off,
and as the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was the first air ship ever
seen in Bayhaven it may be imagined what a sensation
Dr. Perkins’ craft created.
</p>
<p>
But all eager questioners were waved aside
while Dr. Perkins and his young friends called
for volunteers to help lift the injured man out
of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>. A dozen willing hands responded,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
and before long the mate of the <em>Star
of Gloucester</em> was on his way to the hospital in
a wagon which had been hastily converted into
an ambulance. It may be said here that, thanks
to the prompt manner in which aid had been secured
for him, the man recovered after a long
illness, and was able to resume his work on Captain
Zebedee’s ship, where he never tires of telling
of how he was saved by an aërial ambulance.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins accompanied his patient to the
hospital, where he saw him comfortably settled.
In the meantime Frank and Harry had been left
on guard with the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, for the crowd had
grown so large, and so curious, that it would
not have been wise to have left the ship to the
mercies of the inquisitive. The boys answered a
perfect hailstorm of questions as good-naturedly
as possible, but once or twice they had to use
physical means to keep the younger element of
the population of Bayhaven off the decks.
</p>
<p>
By the time Dr. Perkins returned they were
heartily tired of their job, and hailed his proposal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
that they should go up to town and purchase
a fresh supply of provisions, with much
delight. Leaving Dr. Perkins to cope with the
throng, the two boys, arm in arm, made their
way through the press and set off for the main
street, which sloped up from the wharf. One or
two of the crowd followed them, gaping curiously
at the youthful aërial voyagers. But the
boys were too used to the curiosity of crowds to
mind this, and before long their followers
dropped back to gape at the great flying machine.
</p>
<p>
They found the town a small, uninteresting
place. There were several shops, a hotel, with
the usual group of loungers hanging about the
porch, and further back a canning factory, which
gave employment, in one way or another, to most
of the inhabitants of Bayhaven. Beyond the
hotel was a big “general store.” Entering it, the
boys made a variety of purchases, and arranged
that the goods should be shipped to the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
They were just leaving the place when out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
the dusk—for by this time it was getting late—there
came a figure that caused both boys to
come to a dead stop in petrified astonishment.
As for the man who had caused their sudden
stoppage he, for his part, appeared to be nonplussed
for a second. But the next moment he
turned and fairly ran out of the store.
</p>
<p>
“After him!” cried Frank; “it’s that rascal
Duval!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what!” cried Harry, no less excited.
</p>
<p>
Both boys, to the utter amazement of the storekeeper,
who thought they had gone suddenly
crazy, dashed out of the door of the emporium,
and taking the steps outside in one jump they
made off in the direction in which Duval, for
there was no doubt it was he, had vanished. But
as ill luck would have it, the cannery whistle had
just blown for the cessation of the day’s work,
and round the corner there streamed a big crowd
of the employees.
</p>
<p>
It took the boys some time to work their way
through the throng, for some of the men were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
inclined to tease them by stepping in their way
and otherwise annoying them so that by the time
they got through the crowd all hope of catching,
or even sighting, Duval was gone.
</p>
<p>
Greatly disappointed, and almost as much mystified
by their sudden encounter with the rascally
Frenchman, the boys decided to turn back and
go down to the <em>Sea Eagle</em>. On their way they
discussed Duval’s sudden reappearance with interest.
</p>
<p>
“What can he be doing here?” wondered
Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Blessed if I know,” was the rejoinder, “but
I’ll bet he’s up to some mischief or other. My!
How he ran when he saw us.”
</p>
<p>
“He had good reason to,” declared Harry;
“I guess we’d have had him arrested if we’d ever
caught him.”
</p>
<p>
“Not much doubt of that,” declared Frank;
“we could have charged him with the theft of
that boat, anyhow, and that would have held him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
in the custody of the authorities till we could
have obtained further evidence.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t imagine we’ll see him again,”
decided Harry, as they turned into the Main
Street.
</p>
<p>
“No such luck,” declared Frank.
</p>
<p>
But, after all, the boys were to see Duval
again, and sooner than they expected, too.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX.—PLUMBO FOUND WANTING.</h2>
<p>
They were still talking in this vein when they
reached the wharf. The crowd had, by this time,
thinned out somewhat, and they made their way
to the <em>Sea Eagle</em> without difficulty. They found
Dr. Perkins talking with a most peculiar looking
individual. He was long and lanky as a bean
pole, and his thatch of bright red hair was
crowned by a hat that a scarecrow might have
disowned.
</p>
<p>
“Wonder who our new-found friend can be?”
laughed Harry, as they clambered down a rough
ladder to <em>the Sea Eagle’s</em> deck.
</p>
<p>
They soon found out. Dr. Perkins, it appeared,
had decided to spend the night at Bayhaven,
and had engaged quarters at the hotel
which the boys had passed. The man with whom
he was talking rejoiced in the name of Plumbo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
Boggs, and was a village character. However,
he was honest, though not overmuch endowed
with brains, and had been recommended to the
inventor as a reliable man to leave in charge of
the <em>Sea Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p>
Immediately Dr. Perkins had introduced this
strange character, Plumbo broke out into rhymed
speech which was a peculiarity of his. Some odd
twist in his brain made it impossible for him to
express himself in prose.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Plumbo Boggs of old Bayhaven; from
harm your air ship I’ll be savin’,” quoth he,
striking an attitude.
</p>
<p>
“Do you always talk that way?” inquired
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I’m a poet, though you didn’t know it,”
was the response.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t know that that will keep you
from being a good watchman,” smiled Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll watch by day or I’ll watch by night; you’ll
soon find that I’m all right,” was the quick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
response, while Plumbo’s blue, rather watery
eyes, flashed feebly.
</p>
<p>
“That’s satisfactory. Mind, you are to let no
one on board, under any pretext whatever.”
</p>
<p>
“Pretext is a word that I don’t understand;
but I’ll keep them off though they come in a
band,” rejoined Plumbo.
</p>
<p>
“How much will you do the job for?” asked
Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“Two dollars will be my price to stay here;
pay it and then no trouble you’ll fear.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll agree to that,” said Dr. Perkins, “we are
going uptown now. I’ll have your supper sent
down to you and you are to remain here till you
are relieved by us early to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stay right here, watchful and steady;
you’ll find me here when to go you’re ready,”
declared Plumbo.
</p>
<p>
“And now that everything is well I guess we’ll
start for the hotel,” said Frank, and not until
both Dr. Perkins and Harry burst into a roar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
of laughter did he realize that he had caught the
rhyming “infection” from the poetical Plumbo.
</p>
<p>
“Be sure and don’t forget my supper; I like
pork and beans and bread and butter,” called
Plumbo after them as they left the wharf, and
he took up his vigil.
</p>
<p>
“An eccentric sort of character, but I guess
he’ll take good care of the <em>Sea Eagle</em> while we’re
gone,” said Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
It was on the tip of Frank’s tongue to tell
about their encounter with Duval; but the next
instant he decided not to speak of it. Dr. Perkins
had several important matters on his mind,
and after all, the boy argued, Duval could not
do them any harm now. After supper the editor
of the local paper called round at the hotel to
elicit from the aërial voyagers the story of their
trip as far as it had gone. He was also correspondent
for the Associated Press, he informed
them. Dr. Perkins granted him a careful interview,
in which he described part of their adventures,
but was cautious not to reveal any of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
the details of the <em>Sea Eagle’s</em> construction.
Shortly after the newspaperman had taken his
departure the party retired, having left an early
call for the morning, for it had been determined
to get under way as soon as possible the next day.
</p>
<p>
Bayhaven retired early to its rest, and the
streets were deserted when, soon after midnight,
three men walked down the main street, taking
care to keep in the shadows of the buildings as
they proceeded. One of the men was Duval, and
the others were the Daniels, father and son.
Their presence in Bayhaven is soon explained.
</p>
<p>
As we know, the elder Daniels had offered to
get money to finance the trip to the Black Bayou,
and it was from relatives in Bayhaven that he
calculated on getting it. The trio had arrived
in the town the day before, and Daniels had
promptly obtained the money as a loan, he having
represented that the treasure was undoubtedly
to be found in the long-forgotten wreck.
</p>
<p>
They had been on the streets the day before
when the approach of the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was announced,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
and Duval instantly guessed that the
oncoming air ship was the same that had rescued
him and his employers from the illfated
<em>Wanderer</em>. Neither the Daniels nor Duval himself
knew anything of the destination of the <em>Sea
Eagle</em>, nor did they guess for an instant that
Harry Chester carried with him an exact duplicate
of Duval’s stolen plan. But their evil natures
prompted them to do all the harm they
could to the party, and it was with this end in
view that they were making their way down the
badly lighted and deserted streets of Bayhaven
at such an hour. Duval’s dislike of the boys had
been roused to fever heat by their chase of him
in the afternoon, and he was burning to do them
some injury. From one of the elder Daniels’ relatives
the rascals had learned that Dr. Perkins
and his two young friends were registered at
the hotel, leaving the <em>Sea Eagle</em> in charge of
Plumbo. At once they had decided to visit the
air ship and see what harm they could do it.
</p>
<p>
Stealthily they advanced toward the wharf,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
revolving in their minds as they went what they
would do when they got there.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to get that half-witted chap out
of the way,” declared Duval, in a low tone, “or
he may make an outcry and arouse the whole
place.”
</p>
<p>
“Leave that to me,” Daniels assured him;
“we’ll fix him up all right.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean to hurt him? I don’t want
to get mixed up in anything like that,” whimpered
Duval, who was somewhat of a coward,
as we know.
</p>
<p>
Daniels actually chuckled.
</p>
<p>
“Waal, you are a chicken-hearted fool,” he
muttered, “but don’t you be scared. There won’t
be no necessity of hurtin’ this Plumbo. I can
recollect him from a time when I was here years
ago. He’s soft-headed and talks poetry. Them
two things most allers goes together I’ve found.”
</p>
<p>
Nothing more was said till they reached the
wharf. It was dark and deserted, but in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
starlight the dim outlines of the <em>Sea Eagle</em> could
be seen as she lay at her moorings.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bet a cruller that chap’s asleep,” whispered
Zeb, as they crept forward cautiously.
</p>
<p>
“Hope so. It’ll make our work a lot the easier,”
chuckled his worthy father.
</p>
<p>
But the next moment they had undeniable
proof that the watchman was not slumbering.
From amidst the ghostly outlines of the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> came Plumbo’s voice.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s there so late? Answer up, mate.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that you, Plumbo?” said the elder Daniels.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, this is me, as you can see.”
</p>
<p>
“How are we goin’ ter see you when it’s so
confounded dark?” growled Daniels.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you wish? To bathe or fish?”
inquired Plumbo, ignoring this remark. Then
he continued:
</p>
<p>
“You’d better skip. You’ll not board this
ship.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just what we came here to do,” replied
Daniels, in an unruffled tone; “your mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
is very ill and we come down to take charge of
the air ship while you go home as quick as possible.”
</p>
<p>
Now poor Plumbo’s love for his widowed
mother was a matter of common talk in the village,
and the cunning of the elder Daniels had
suggested this scheme to him as they came along.
It worked even better than he had dared to expect.
The rhyming watchman gave a gasp of
pained astonishment.
</p>
<p>
“I must go home; though I ought not to roam,”
he said.
</p>
<p>
“Make your mind easy about that, lad,” Daniels
assured him; “we’ll watch this cloud clipper
while you’re gone. Dr. Perkins told us to stay
here while you are gone.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go home in a hurry; be back in a scurry,”
declared Plumbo, who was completely taken in.
His none too acute brain had been easily imposed
upon by Daniels’ rascally trick. He scrambled
up on the wharf and at once set off on a run for
his home, crying as he went:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
</p>
<p>
“Watch every crack till I can get back.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, go to the dickens while we get our pickin’s,”
growled out young Zeb Daniels, at which
specimen of wit his father laughed heartily,
though in a subdued way.
</p>
<p>
“Now, then, boys,” said Daniels, as Plumbo’s
footsteps died away, “get busy and spile this
cruise for that bunch of fine gentlemen. We’ll
show ’em what it means to try to take folks’ livings
away.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX.—FRANK’S BATTLE.</h2>
<p>
It was about midnight that Frank, for no reason
that he could explain, awakened with a vague
feeling of uneasiness. Try as he would he could
not compose himself to sleep again, but lay
awake, struggling with a sort of intuitive suspicion
that all was not well with the <em>Sea Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p>
At last, so strong did his conviction become,
that, although he was ridiculing his fears all the
time, he arose and dressed himself, and then
started out for the wharf. For a moment he
thought he would rouse Harry, who slept on another
bed in the same room; but in the end he
decided not to disturb his brother’s repose. Perhaps
he had a vague fear of ridicule, but at any
rate Frank crept out of the hotel alone and made
his way silently down the dark and empty streets.
</p>
<p>
“This is certainly a fool’s errand I’m going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
on,” he told himself; “I suppose that my reward
for my pains will be to hear some more of
Plumbo’s poetry, and yet—and yet, I can’t help
it. I couldn’t sleep another wink unless I was
sure that the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was all right.”
</p>
<p>
Musing thus, and minimizing his own fears,
Frank came in due time to the wharf. He made
his way down it and was about to step forward
to descend the ladder that led to the <em>Sea Eagle’s</em>
deck, when he heard something that made him
pause. He recognized the sound instantly.
</p>
<p>
It was the rasp of a file!
</p>
<p>
“My gracious! Somebody <em>is</em> tampering with
the <em>Sea Eagle</em>!” exclaimed the boy to himself.
“My fears were not as groundless as I thought
them, after all. I wonder if that rascal Duval——”
</p>
<p>
The current of his thoughts was suddenly
checked at this point by another noise near at
hand. It seemed to come from behind a big pile
of boxes on the wharf.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! What’s that?” thought Frank,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
and then for the first time it flashed across him
that if more than one man was engaged in the
nefarious work that he was sure was going on,
he was at a serious disadvantage. He had no
weapons but his hands, whereas the others were
undoubtedly well armed.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll slip back uptown as quickly as I can and
arouse the authorities,” he decided, “if they are
quick we can catch the rascals red-handed. I
wonder what can have become of that fellow
Jumbo or whatever his name was? I suppose he
went to sleep or something. Well, it serves us
right for leaving such an eccentric fellow on
guard.”
</p>
<p>
Frank, who had been crouching in the shadow
of the very boxes behind which he had heard the
suspicious sounds, rose quickly to his feet. He
was just slipping off, congratulating himself that
he had been unobserved when from behind the
boxes a dark figure suddenly emerged.
</p>
<p>
“Hands up, Frank Chester,” it exclaimed;
“we’ve got you where we want you this time.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
</p>
<p>
“Zeb Daniels!” exclaimed Frank, dumbfounded
with astonishment. He had not supposed
the rascally young fisherman within miles
of the place.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; that’s me. Don’t move a step or you’ll
get hurt.”
</p>
<p>
But Frank’s indignation overcame his prudence.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing here?” he demanded angrily.
</p>
<p>
“None of your business.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t, eh? Well I know that you are damaging
Dr. Perkins’ boat in some way and——”
</p>
<p>
Frank stepped deftly aside as Zeb, who was a
far heavier, stronger boy than the young aviator,
made a tigerish jump at him, at the same
time brandishing a thick club threateningly.
</p>
<p>
But Zeb’s sudden rush proved his undoing.
Before he could recover his balance Frank had
planted a clean, hard punch on the young ruffian’s
jaw, and Zeb reeled back dizzily. He recovered
himself almost instantly, however, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
without making a sound hurled himself at Frank
once more. In a rough and tumble fight the
sturdily built fisher boy might have been a match
for Frank Chester, but Frank had already gained
some advantage and he met Zeb’s frenzied charge
coolly.
</p>
<p>
Zeb, as he got within reach, let loose a tremendous
swing which, if it had struck Frank’s
head as his burly young opponent intended, might
have laid him flat. But to his astonishment Zeb’s
fist met only empty air. Frank had ducked the
blow with consummate ease, and the next instant:
</p>
<p>
One! Two!—Crack! Smack! Two well-planted
blows landed on Zeb’s face and body.
Frank was rushing in to complete his victory
when he was suddenly seized from behind in a
powerful grip and hurled to the ground with
great violence.
</p>
<p>
Zeb’s father, on board the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, had
heard the disturbance, and had swiftly and silently
climbed the ladder leading up on to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
wharf. Behind him, but at a prudent distance,
came Duval. The Frenchman had no love for
fighting, unless the odds were all in his favor,
and he was by no means certain how many men
might have attacked them.
</p>
<p>
The elder Daniels took in the situation in a
flash, and pinioned Frank’s arms, just as the
latter was about to put an end to the battle. Duval
saw instantly that there was no personal danger
to himself, and while the elder Daniels held
a grimy, leathery paw over Frank’s mouth to
prevent his shouting for aid, Duval pinioned the
lad’s lower limbs. Helpless as a baby Frank lay
there on his back, completely at the mercy of
three individuals whom he had no reason to suppose
would handle him gently.
</p>
<p>
While he still lay there a helpless captive,
young Daniels came up, and doubling up his fist
deliberately struck the helpless boy in the face.
But the elder of the Daniels angrily checked him.
</p>
<p>
“Stow that,” he muttered roughly. “What’s
the matter with you?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wanted to get even with him,” whined Zeb;
“he licked me and——”
</p>
<p>
“Waal, git even some other way. Bring me
that rope off them pile of boxes while I make
him fast.”
</p>
<p>
Zeb said no more, but obediently fetched the
rope, and before many minutes had passed Frank
was bound hand and foot. Moreover, a gag,
consisting of a dirty fragment torn from the
elder Daniels’ shirt, was thrust into his mouth.
</p>
<p>
“What’ll we do with him now?” demanded
Zeb, when this had been done.
</p>
<p>
“Humph, I hadn’t thought of that,” rejoined
the elder fisherman; “we can’t leave him here,
for we don’t want any one to find him when they
come down, as they are bound to do afore long
when that idiot Plumbo finds out that we’ve
fooled him. What <em>will</em> we do with the young
game cock?”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to chuck him overboard,” quoth Zeb
amiably, staunching his bleeding nose with a
dirty coat sleeve.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t waste time talking rubbish,” angrily
rejoined his parent; “see here, Duval, kain’t you
think of something?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I can,” was the eager reply; “it’s just
occurred to me. Ho! ho! I guess that’ll keep
him quiet for a while.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you propose to do?” growled
Daniels. “Don’t stand there like an owl. Out
with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, my friend, you see those big barrels
over there?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, what about them?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll put him in one of those and give him a
sea trip.”
</p>
<p>
“By Jeehosophat, but that’s a notion! I reckon
by the time he’s picked up, or drifts ashore, he’ll
be sorry he interfered with us.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a great scheme,” chuckled Zeb, equally
delighted. “That’s what I call getting even in
good shape.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold on a minute; how’s the tide?” murmured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
Daniels. “We don’t want him to be picked up too
quick.”
</p>
<p>
“The tide’s running out, pop,” said Zeb, after
a minute; “I tell you, though, what’s the matter
with putting the barrel in that dory there and
then loading him in it? We can row out a ways
and then dump him overside.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the best idea yet,” warmly approved
his worthy parent; “come on, boys, tumble the
barrel into that dory. Lively, now!”
</p>
<p>
The barrel, quite a big one, which had been
used for salting down fish and was quite watertight,
was lowered into the dory that Zeb’s sharp
eyes had spied with some difficulty.
</p>
<p>
Frank had watched the movements of his captors
as well as he could in the darkness; but he
was quite unable to guess what all this meant,
which, perhaps, was just as well. As the conversation
had been carried on in whispers, he had
not overheard a syllable of the rascally plan to
set him adrift out of pure malice.
</p>
<p>
Still bound and gagged, he was lowered into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
the dory, unable to call out or move, despite the
now serious alarm he felt. What could the men
be going to do with him, he wondered, and was
still busy speculating on his probable fate when
Zeb and his father cast off the dory and, with
rapid strokes, began to row toward the mouth of
the harbor on which Bayhaven is situated.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI.—A RASCALLY TRICK.</h2>
<p>
While all this had been occurring on the wharf
Plumbo Boggs had discovered the deception that
had been practiced on him, and was hastening
as fast as he could to the hotel. Even he, whose
mind could not be called quick acting, realized
that he was the victim of a trick, the object of
which was, in all probability, to injure the <em>Sea
Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p>
Arousing the night clerk, Plumbo begged to
be directed to Dr. Perkins’ room. The night
clerk knew the eccentric character, and lost no
time in escorting him to the doctor’s quarters.
Plumbo thundered on the door with noise sufficient
to arouse the other guests.
</p>
<p>
“What is it? What’s happened?” shouted Dr.
Perkins, thinking for an instant that the place
must be on fire at least.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, doctor, come quick! They’ve played us
a trick!” yelled Plumbo.
</p>
<p>
“Who? Where? What do you mean?” exclaimed
Dr. Perkins, coming to the door.
</p>
<p>
“Two men and a lad; they’ve fooled me bad.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean that they persuaded you to
leave the <em>Sea Eagle</em> alone and unguarded?”
</p>
<p>
“They told me a story to get me from there; or
I’d have given your air ship the best of good
care,” pleaded Plumbo, seriously alarmed at the
angry look that had come over the doctor’s face.
“Don’t be angry with me, I pray; if they hurt
it I’ll ask you no pay.”
</p>
<p>
“As if that would help,” cried Dr. Perkins
angrily; “wait there till I get some clothes on.”
</p>
<p>
He retreated into the room and as he hastily
donned some garments he wondered who the
men could be who had induced the soft-witted
poet to leave his position of trust.
</p>
<p>
“For the life of me I can’t imagine who they
can be,” he was thinking, while he hurriedly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
laced his shoes, when the door opened and in
walked Harry fully dressed.
</p>
<p>
“I heard the noise in the corridor, and heard
Plumbo telling you that something had happened
to the <em>Sea Eagle</em>,” he said excitedly.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that anything has happened
yet,” cried Dr. Perkins anxiously; “I’m hoping
not. But from what I can gather from Plumbo’s
foolish talk three men induced him, on some pretext,
to leave the ship unguarded. I must say it
looks suspicious. But I cannot think who there
is in this place where we are unknown who would
want to harm us.”
</p>
<p>
The thought of Duval flashed across Harry’s
mind. He and Frank had decided not to tell
Dr. Perkins about their encounter lest it should
worry him; but surely the time to tell about it
had come now.
</p>
<p>
“We ought to have told you,” he said, rather
falteringly, “but we did not want to cause you
undue anxiety,—we saw Duval this afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
“What!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins almost shouted the question, or
rather exclamation, in a thunderstruck tone.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. We tried to catch him, but he escaped
us. Frank can tell you all about it. By the way,
where is Frank?”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t he in your room?”
</p>
<p>
“No; when I was awakened by the noise in
the passage I saw that his bed was empty. I
supposed that he had got out of bed ahead of me
and had come in here.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t seen him since we retired.”
</p>
<p>
“Then where can he be?”
</p>
<p>
The inventor and the boy aviator stared at
each other for an instant.
</p>
<p>
“Good gracious, this looks serious, indeed,”
exclaimed Dr. Perkins; “not in his room, and
not in the hotel, apparently. Where can he have
gone to?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what’s worrying me,” cried Harry, in
a rather quavering tone; “I’m sure, perfectly
sure, that that rascal Duval knows something
about him wherever he is. Maybe he heard some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
word of a plot to injure the <em>Sea Eagle</em> and has
gone down to see if he can frustrate it. Duval——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but Duval, if it is he, is not alone in this
thing. Plumbo says there were two men and a
lad.”
</p>
<p>
“Two men and a lad,” cried Harry joyously,
“then the lad must have been Frank.”
</p>
<p>
“But who could the others have been? They
all came together and sent our watchman away.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s all a deep mystery, doctor. I think our
best plan is to make all the speed we can to the
wharf. Perhaps we can find some solution
there.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; let us do so at once. I am all ready,
are you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I hurried to get dressed as soon as I
heard the noise in the corridor.”
</p>
<p>
Plumbo was waiting, and as they hastened
down the street he explained in his odd rhyming
speech just what had happened. He could not
describe the men except to say that one had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
whiskers on his chin. In a part of the country
where this is a favorite facial adornment this
information was not much of a clew.
</p>
<p>
It took the alarmed party much less time to
reach the wharf than they would have thought
was possible. In fact, almost the whole distance
was traversed at a run. But when they arrived
at the wharf and a lantern, which Dr. Perkins
had had the foresight to bring along, had been
kindled, they found nothing to inform them as
to what had taken place. The doctor had not
expected to find Plumbo’s three men there, but
he had had an idea that he would find something
damaged about the <em>Sea Eagle</em>. But as careful
an examination as it was possible to make by
lamplight failed to reveal any trace of damage.
</p>
<p>
Naturally this, instead of helping to clear the
mystery, only deepened it. What object could
the men have had who had sent Plumbo off on
his wild goose chase if it had not been to wreak
injury to the <em>Sea Eagle</em>?
</p>
<p>
“Maybe they were some inventors who wanted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
to steal your ideas,” suggested Harry, recalling
some experiences of their own with unscrupulous
aviators.
</p>
<p>
But Dr. Perkins shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Every important feature of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
is fully covered by patents,” he said; “there isn’t
a single idea they could appropriate in the short
time they could have spent here anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
Harry had to admit that this was so, but to
tell the truth his thoughts were centered more
on Frank and on the strange circumstances surrounding
his disappearance than they were on the
<em>Sea Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p>
“I’m as certain as that daylight will come again
that Frank fits into this mix-up somewhere,” he
said, voicing his thoughts, “but the question is
where?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he’s not here now, that’s certain,” declared
Dr. Perkins. “I propose that we should
return to the hotel now that we have discovered
that no damage has been done. He may meet
us there.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
</p>
<p>
“Let’s search the wharf first,” said Harry, but,
naturally, even their painstaking search failed
to reveal any trace of Frank’s fate till, all at
once, Harry, who was carrying the lantern, came
upon his brother’s cap lying where it had fallen
in the scuffle among the boxes.
</p>
<p>
The bit of headgear had been kicked close to
the string-piece of the wharf, and a fearful fear
that made Harry’s head swim shot into his mind.
Could Frank have come down to the wharf, suspecting
mischief was on foot, and have either
fallen or been thrown into the water?
</p>
<p>
“Look—look here, sir,” he exclaimed in a
shaking voice, as Dr. Perkins asked him what
was the matter.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked the doctor, coming forward.
“A clew?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; it’s—it’s Frank’s cap, doctor. Pray
heaven no harm has befallen him.”
</p>
<p>
“If it has, swift vengeance is going to overtake
somebody,” declared Dr. Perkins, clenching
his hands; “where did you find the cap?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
</p>
<p>
“Close to the string-piece. You—you don’t
think he could have fallen over?”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense,” declared Dr. Perkins with a confidence
he was far from feeling; “we’ll get him
back again safe and sound, never fear.”
</p>
<p>
But Harry’s heart sank as he fingered his
brother’s cap.
</p>
<p>
“I’m trying to think so, too, sir,” he said miserably;
“but—but——”
</p>
<p>
He paused abruptly, for he could not have
gone further without breaking down. Harry
had gone through some anxious moments in his
life, but never had his heart sunk so low as it
did that night on the Bayhaven wharf.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, let us see how it was faring
with the boy whose disappearance had caused
such cruel fears—fears which even the vengeful
tempers of Daniels and his son would have been
satisfied with. We left Frank gagged and bound
on the bottom of the dory, while Zeb and his
father were pulling with strong, swift strokes
for the open water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
</p>
<p>
The dory shot swiftly and silently seaward,
with Frank completely in the dark as to what
was to be his fate. It occurred to him, though,
that perhaps they meant to maroon him on some
island. This thought did not give him so much
anxiety as might have been expected, for he
knew that the waters about Bayhaven were fairly
populous with boats, and did not suppose that his
captors meant to keep him a prisoner any longer
time than would be necessary for them to take
their departure from that part of the coast before
the authorities could be notified.
</p>
<p>
Imagine, then, his thrill of surprise when the
boat suddenly stopped and the barrel, into which
some big stones had been thrown to keep it upright
in the water, was lowered from the dory.
This done, Frank was lifted by main force and
placed in it.
</p>
<p>
A brutal laugh broke from Zeb and his father
as they shoved the barrel containing its helpless
captive away from the side of the dory. Duval
said nothing, but his white teeth showed in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
grin in the starlight. Frank, gagged as he was,
could not utter a word or move a limb. He could
only realize, with dumb agony, the terrible nature
of his fate.
</p>
<p>
Still laughing, the brutal rascals who had conceived
the idea of setting him adrift, rowed off
at a quick rate, leaving the barrel and its helpless
occupant bobbing up and down on the swells
of the starlit sea.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII.—REUNITED!</h2>
<p>
Frank’s heart sank as he cast a look about him
and perceived the helplessness of his position.
</p>
<p>
“If I could only get this gag off and shout for
help,” he thought, “maybe somebody would hear
me.”
</p>
<p>
But there seemed to be no means of compassing
this end, try as he would to think of some way.
All at once, as the stars were beginning to fade
and a faint flush of gray appeared in the east,
he perceived a nail sticking up on the rim of the
barrel. This gave him an idea. By bending
slightly he would be able to bring the edge of the
gag against the sharp pointed bit of metal, and
possibly tear it out. At any rate, it was worth
trying, and Frank at once proceeded to put his
plan into action.
</p>
<p>
It was a hard job to bend low enough to bring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
his mouth on a level with the nail, but fortunately
the barrel was a large one, and consequently he
had not so very far to stoop. By making a desperate
effort he succeeded at last in dragging the
gag across the nail. In doing this he scratched
his chin, but he did not mind that, for the nail
caught and held the rag, tearing it out of his
mouth as he moved his head.
</p>
<p>
“Hurray!” breathed Frank, inhaling a great
lungful of fresh air. “Now I can at least make
a racket, and maybe that will bring some one.”
</p>
<p>
With all his might he began shouting for help.
In the still morning air his voice carried clearly
across the water, and to the lad’s huge delight it
was not long before he perceived, coming toward
him a small fishing boat, which, from the “chugging”
sound it made, was evidently furnished
with a gasolene engine.
</p>
<p>
But the question that now agitated the boy
was, “Would they see him or hear his voice above
the loud noise of the motor?” If they did not,
Frank realized that his plight would pass from a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
serious to a desperate state, for the barrel was,
by this time, caught in a current which was rapidly
increasing the distance between himself and
the shore.
</p>
<p>
To his intense relief, however, he saw the fishing
boat suddenly change her course, and before
long she was close enough for him to read the
name “<em>Two Sisters</em>” on her broad, bluff bow.
</p>
<p>
“Waal, by the tarnal!” came a gruff voice,
“who and what are yer out here in a ba’rl?”
</p>
<p>
The speaker, a burly-looking fellow, with a
rough but kindly countenance, regarded Frank’s
face, which was all that was visible of him, with
the most intense astonishment, as well he might.
In a long experience off shore, covering all sorts
of adventures, Captain Elihu Carney of the <em>Two
Sisters</em> had never before beheld a floating barrel
with a human head projecting from it.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a kid—a boy!” shouted one of his mates
from the stern of the <em>Two Sisters</em>, where he held
the tiller.
</p>
<p>
“Crack-e-e! so it air. Hey, kid, what yer doin’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
out here? Takin’ a cruise, or is this one of them
new-fangled health cures?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s neither, I assure you,” cried Frank; “get
me out of this and I’ll tell you all about it.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll run alongside and you can climb out.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I can’t,” returned Frank; “I’m bound
hand and foot.”
</p>
<p>
“What! Say, you be’ant one of them movin’
picter fellers makin’ a fillum be yer?”
</p>
<p>
Captain Carney’s rugged face held a look full
of suspicion. Once not long before his boat had
been boarded by a beauteous maiden, apparently
fleeing from a band of desperadoes. The gallant
captain had fished her out of the dory in which
she was rowing from her pursuers and had
threatened the apparent rascals with all sorts of
dire things. Then to his chagrin a voice had
hailed him:
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you old mossback! You’ve spoiled a
grind!”
</p>
<p>
A “grind” being moving picture language for
a film.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
“I certainly am not,” returned Frank indignantly;
“no moving pictures about this, I can
tell you. This is the real thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Waal, as I don’t see no camera about I
reckon it’s all right. Put her head round, Eph,
and we’ll pick him up, but ‘once bitten twice shy,’
you know.”
</p>
<p>
Eph, the helmsman, brought the bow of the
<em>Two Sisters</em> round and slowed up the engine. A
minute later the fishing boat’s side was scraping
the barrel, and Captain Carney’s muscular arms
lifted Frank out of his floating prison as if he
had been an infant.
</p>
<p>
“Waal, I’ll be double decked consarned!” he
roared, as he saw the ropes that confined the
boy’s limbs. “Who done this?”
</p>
<p>
“Some rascals who had good cause to wish
me harm,” said Frank. “I suppose they thought
they could get rid of me while they made their
escape.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the world comin’ to?” cried the rugged
skipper, throwing up his hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
</p>
<p>
He reached into his belt for a tarry sailor’s
knife and cut Frank loose in a few strokes of
the keen blade. But the boy was so stiff from
loss of circulation that it was some time before
he recovered the use of his limbs. The <em>Two Sisters</em>,
it turned out, was headed for Bayhaven, to
which port she belonged, but so far had Frank
drifted in his—or rather somebody else’s barrel—that
he was able to tell his whole story before
the wharf was reached.
</p>
<p>
As they neared it the skipper ordered Eph to
blow the compressed air whistle so as to apprise
every one ashore that something unusual was
happening. Among the crowd that hastened to
the wharf in response to the frenzied tooting
Frank recognized Dr. Perkins and Harry. As
they drew close he saw how white and strained
their faces were, and realized what anxiety they
must have been through on his account. He
shouted loudly, and at the sound of his voice
both Harry and the staid inventor set up a series
of cheers that drowned the tooting of the whistle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
As for Plumbo Boggs, who was also on the
wharf, he burst into rhyme at once.
</p>
<p>
“Home again! home again from the stormy
sea; now that your chum is found all right, don’t
blame me!”
</p>
<p>
So saying he capered about, snapping his fingers
and performing a dozen odd antics while
the <em>Two Sisters</em> was making fast. Without waiting
for Frank, who was still stiff and sore, to
come up on the wharf, Harry and Dr. Perkins
jumped to the deck of the <em>Two Sisters</em>, and the
former fairly threw his arms about his brother’s
neck.
</p>
<p>
“If you only knew how glad I am you have
come back,” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“What ever happened to you?” demanded Dr.
Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a long story,” said Frank, “and I’m famished.
Suppose we ask Captain Carney and Eph
to breakfast with us and while we are eating I’ll
tell you all about it.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII.—OFF ONCE MORE.</h2>
<p>
AS our readers are fully acquainted with
Frank’s adventure it would only tedious to
relate all that took place at the breakfast. It
may be said, however, that both Captain Carney
and his mate received a substantial recognition
of their services, from Dr. Perkins, in the form
of a check. At first the bluff fishermen were by
no means willing to take pay for what they had
done, but were finally prevailed upon to accept
the present, which, as Captain Carney owned,
“would come in mighty handy.”
</p>
<p>
After the conclusion of the meal all hands
adjourned to the wharf, and a thorough examination
was made once more of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>,
with the object of detecting any damage which
the Daniels and Duval might have done her, and
which might have been overlooked in the lamplight investigation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
made by Dr. Perkins and
Harry. A bright spot was found on one of the
metal braces. Undeniably it had been done by
the teeth of a file, but it was only a superficial
damage, which did not affect the strength of the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> in any way.
</p>
<p>
“I guess Frank scared them away before they
had time to do any more harm,” was Dr. Perkins’
conclusion; but later on he was to have a different
opinion.
</p>
<p>
As things were at present, however, Dr. Perkins
felt no hesitation in declaring the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
fit to resume her voyage without further delay.
The fresh provisions being on board, and there
being nothing to prevent an immediate start, the
voyagers at once made ready for a continuance
of the trip which, so far, had proved so packed
with adventure.
</p>
<p>
The gasolene tank was refilled, and the emergency
receptacles for the liquid fuel seen to.
Plumbo Boggs was paid and instructions left to
telegraph Dr. Perkins in New Orleans in case
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
any trace was found of the miscreants, who undoubtedly
had intended to injure the <em>Sea Eagle</em>,
and who had played such a dastardly trick on
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll fly from the sea far up to the sky;
good-by! good-by! good-by! good-by!” cried
Plumbo Boggs as the ropes that held the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> to the wharf were cast off and, amidst a
loud cheer from the crowd, the engine was
started.
</p>
<p>
It was a fine summer morning with a glassy
sea and a sky that was cloudless, except in the
east, where a great mass of castellated white
clouds were piled up.
</p>
<p>
“You’d best hug the shore,” were Captain Carney’s
parting words of advice. “To my mind
we’ll have a storm of some sort before the day’s
out.”
</p>
<p>
But in the noise and excitement of the departure
his words were unheard and the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> started off down the coast with the warning
unheeded. Dr. Perkins ran the craft over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
the water till the mouth of the harbor was
reached, easily outdistancing some fast launches
that tried to keep up with them. When they got
“outside,” the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was driven ahead at
top speed, and with her rising planes set at a
sharp angle she was driven upward till a height
of some five hundred and fifty feet had been
obtained. Her course was due south.
</p>
<p>
They were flying over a small island not far
from the shore when Frank, who was looking
over the side, noticed a dory ashore on the beach.
He had hardly noticed this before three figures
came running down to the beach and pointed upward.
One of them jerked a rifle up to his shoulder,
and a minute later a puff of smoke came
from the barrel. Simultaneously a bullet sang
through the rigging of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, boring a
small hole in one of the upper planes, but, fortunately,
not striking any vital part of the craft
or doing injury to her passengers.
</p>
<p>
“That’s those rascals now!” exclaimed Frank
indignantly. “They must have rowed down to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
that island and are waiting there for a chance to
get ashore quietly. Shall we go down and attack
them?”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing much would be gained by it,” he
said, “and it would only delay our trip.”
</p>
<p>
The <em>Sea Eagle</em> was flying fast, and the rascals
on the island, who, as Frank had rightly guessed,
were the two Daniels and Duval, had no chance
to try a second shot. At noon, after a steady
flight all the morning, the voyagers found themselves
off Martha’s Vineyard. A hasty lunch
was eaten in midair, with the <em>Sea Eagle</em> still
winging her way like a grayhound of the sky.
</p>
<p>
The shore swam by below them like a panorama,
but they only viewed it indistinctly, as the
course was kept about five miles off shore. In
the afternoon they saw, off to the right, a stretch
of mammoth hotels and amusement resorts.
</p>
<p>
“Atlantic City!” cried Frank. “I’ll bet there
are hundreds of glasses leveled at us from the
boardwalk right now.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess so,” rejoined Harry. “We must look
funny way out here at sea.”
</p>
<p>
It was half an hour later that Frank’s
attention was attracted to the sky by the
sudden blotting out of the sun, which had been
shining brightly. He gave a cry of alarm as he
looked upward. A vast bank of black clouds had
come rolling up, like a sable curtain, blotting out
the blue sky. The sea below was leaden and angry
in hue, and its surface was flecked with
white caps.
</p>
<p>
“We’re in for some bad weather, I’m afraid,”
declared Dr. Perkins, when Frank called his attention
to it.
</p>
<p>
Hardly had he spoken before, from the cloud
bank, a red, jagged flash of lightning blazed. It
was followed almost instantly by a sharp clap
of thunder, and some heavy rain drops began
to patter on the broad upper planes of the <em>Sea
Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll make for shore,” declared Dr. Perkins;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
“we must be about off Cape May now. We can
lie there in shelter till this blows itself out.”
</p>
<p>
“That will be the best idea,” said Frank.
“This is going to be a hummer. Wow! Look
at that!”
</p>
<p>
A flash of lightning, that seemed as if the
whole curtain of clouds had been split from top
to bottom, had caused his exclamation. So
brilliant was the glare that it caused them all
to blink involuntarily.
</p>
<p>
“Put on full speed, Frank!” shouted Dr. Perkins
above the deafening peal of thunder that
followed.
</p>
<p>
Frank needed no second bidding. He opened
both gasolene and spark levers to their full capacity.
Dr. Perkins had already headed the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> for the distant low-lying shore. This
caused the craft to plunge almost as much as if
she were “bucking” into a heavy sea. For the
wind was off shore, and the thunder storm, as
such storms frequently do, was coming up
against it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, in the midst of the fight with the
wind, Frank noticed an ominous sound from the
motor. It gave a sort of spluttering, coughing
exhaust and slowed down perceptibly.
</p>
<p>
“What’s wrong now?” he exclaimed anxiously.
“Gracious, if the motor should go out of business
now!”
</p>
<p>
He did not say this aloud, but bent over the
laboring machine to try and ascertain what was
the matter with it.
</p>
<p>
“More speed!” cried Dr. Perkins from the forward
part of the air ship; “we can’t fight this
wind at this pace.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s something the matter with the motor,”
shouted Frank above the now almost continuous
rolling of the thunder. “I can’t make
out what——”
</p>
<p>
A sudden loud report, like a pistol shot, came
from the engine—a back-fire, as it is called—and
the next instant the motor stopped dead.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Sea Eagle</em> was at that moment some 750
feet above the angry sea, with the storm raging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
about her furiously. Before Dr. Perkins could
realize what had happened, the big craft began
to drop downward with sickening velocity, while
her occupants clung on to whatever was handy,
with the desperate clutch of drowning men.
</p>
<p>
Frank had just time to shout:
</p>
<p>
“The life preservers! Quick, quick! for heaven’s
sake!”
</p>
<p>
But there was no time to obey the order before
the <em>Sea Eagle</em> struck the waves, hurling
spray and wind-driven foam in a great cloud
all about her wings and substructure.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV.—A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE.</h2>
<p>
The next moments were filled with anxiety.
The sea was running high, and, although Dr.
Perkins had brought his craft upon a level keel
by skillful volplaning, before it struck the waves,
the situation was extremely serious.
</p>
<p>
The hydroplane portion of the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was
built lightly, and, although it was well strengthened
with braces, the test was a severe one. Over
the bow the crests of the waves broke constantly,
showering the occupants with spray. The <em>Sea
Eagle</em> was tossed about helplessly, a plaything
of the waves, while her adventurers strove to collect
their thoughts and decide what was to be
done.
</p>
<p>
First they adopted Frank’s suggestion and
donned the life jackets, so that if the worst came
to the worst they would have a fighting chance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
for their lives. When this had been done, Frank,
who had had some experience in motor boats,
supervised the rigging of a “spray-hood” across
the bow. This kept some of the spray out, and,
although it was formed of sheets of spare canvas
intended to be used as waterproof night coverings,
it answered its purpose well enough.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think that there is a chance of our
keeping afloat?” asked Harry when this had been
done.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we appear to be making out all right
so far,” rejoined Dr. Perkins; “the wing floats
are working well, and if only we can get the engine
going again we may be able to fly ashore
yet.”
</p>
<p>
The wing floats referred to were nothing more
nor less than the light cylindrical pontoons affixed
to each lower wing tip. They acted precisely
as “outriggers” would do in steadying the <em>Sea
Eagle</em>. In fact, had it not been for this lateral
support, the craft must have turned turtle under
the terrific tossing she was receiving.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m going right to work on the engine,” announced
Frank.
</p>
<p>
With Harry to help him, the lad proceeded to
carry out this purpose. But it was the hardest
bit of “trouble finding” he had ever done. The
motion of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, as she was tossed on a
wave crest and then hurled into the abyss beyond,
made it hard to hold on, let alone investigating
the complicated mechanism of a motor.
But as time wore on and they still kept afloat,
they began to have hopes that they would at least
stay on the surface till the engine could be started
once more.
</p>
<p>
One after another Frank made the different
tests employed to ascertain the various troubles
that may assail a gasolene motor. He tested the
ignition, the spark, the gasolene supply and the
bearings. Everything appeared to be all right,
and he paused in a puzzled way before he went
to work on the carburetor. That is a delicate
piece of mechanism, even to an ingenious boy
like Frank Chester; but he finally concluded that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
the trouble must lie there. His first task was
to open the relief cock and drain the brass bowl
of the mixing chamber.
</p>
<p>
He turned the valve, and the mystery of the
stoppage of the engine was instantly explained.
</p>
<p>
Sand had been placed in the carburetor by persons
whom Frank had little difficulty in mentally
identifying.
</p>
<p>
“So that was what those rascals did!” he cried
aloud. “No wonder we couldn’t find anything
the trouble with the ship. They were too foxy
for that, and could hardly have found a better
way of injuring the <em>Sea Eagle</em> than to do that.”
</p>
<p>
“Is there any way of fixing the damage?”
asked Dr. Perkins, who, with Harry, had hastened
to Frank’s side as he cried out over his discovery.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Thank goodness, we’ve got a spare carburetor
on board, for it would take a week to
clean out this. If no sand has got into the cylinders
I think I can promise to get things going
again before very long.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
</p>
<p>
Out of the locker in which the spare parts
were kept Frank produced another carburetor.
But unscrewing the feed pipe and taking off the
old mixing chamber and adjusting the new one
were tedious tasks, especially under the circumstances
in which Frank was compelled to work.
But at last it was done, and with a beating heart
Frank adjusted the self-starter. A few seconds
now would decide their fate.
</p>
<p>
Harry shivered in anticipation of failure as his
brother, having got the engine going by the just
mentioned appliance, turned on the gasolene and
spark.
</p>
<p>
For a breathless instant their fate hung in the
balance, and then there came the welcome sound
of the exhaust. Bit by bit Frank allowed the
speed to increase, till the engine was running at
its full capacity of revolutions. But the propellers
were not turning, as before testing the
motor he had thrown the clutch out of gear.
</p>
<p>
“I think that we can try to rise now,” he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
calmly, after the motor had run without a miss
or a skip for ten minutes or so.
</p>
<p>
“I think so, too,” said Dr. Perkins, “and I
want to tell you, Frank, that you have done what
I would not have believed possible under the conditions.”
</p>
<p>
Another anxious moment followed when the
clutch was thrown in and the full load of the propellers
came upon the engine. But not a hitch
occurred. The large-bladed driving fans of the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> beat the air rapidly and surely, and
the hydroplane-formed underbody began to glide
over the tops of the waves, instead of rolling and
pitching helplessly among them. To the westward,
too, there showed a patch of lighter sky,
heralding the passing of the storm.
</p>
<p>
But, as if unwilling to allow them to escape
without again bringing their hearts into their
mouths, the storm had one more buffeting to
give them. As full power was applied, and the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> rose above the tossing wave crests
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
and headed slantingly skyward, there came a sudden
puff of wind.
</p>
<p>
Skillful as Dr. Perkins was, it caught him momentarily
unprepared. In the wink of an eye the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> careened over, almost on her “beam
ends.” It seemed as if the right hand wing tips
actually touched the water. One inch more and
there might have been an abrupt conclusion to
this story, but Dr. Perkins’ hands seemed to be
everywhere at once. They flashed among levers
and wheels.
</p>
<p>
For the space of a breath the <em>Sea Eagle</em> hung
almost vertically, and then the big craft suddenly
righted and shot upward on an even keel
once more. But the moment had been an awful
one, and as they winged their way upward not
one aboard was there but felt that they had been
delivered from a dreadful fate by what might
well be described as a miracle.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV.—A RACE TO CLOUDLAND.</h2>
<p>
Scudding before the wind, for the half gale
that was blowing had shifted during their battle
with the waves, the aërial voyagers made fast
time beneath the storm wrack racing by overhead.
In fact, it appeared to the boys that they
actually outflew the wind. At any rate, it was
not long before the thunder of the great breakers
on a low, sandy beach told them that they were
close to the shore.
</p>
<p>
An instant later houses and streets came into
view, and Dr. Perkins began looking anxiously
about beneath for a place to land. He soon spied
a spot,—a large ball-ground, or at least it appeared
to be one, not far from the center of the
city. Calling to Frank to “stand by” the engines,
he began to descend in a series of circles.
</p>
<p>
Coming to earth in a high wind is a risky bit
of business for the air man, about as dangerous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
a maneuver, in fact, as can be imagined. But in
this case there was no choice for Dr. Perkins
and his young friends, unless they wanted to be
carried clear across the cape and into Delaware
Bay.
</p>
<p>
Below them they could now see excited crowds
racing toward the ball-ground, as soon as it became
evident that that was the spot where the air
men intended to alight. This did not please Dr.
Perkins at all. A crowd was the last thing that
he wished to have about when he made his drop
earthward. But there was no help for it, and he
kept on descending, trusting to the good sense of
the throngs below to get out of the way when the
time came.
</p>
<p>
But crowds have never been remarkable for
their common sense, and this one was no exception.
The last “bank” had been made with
safety, and the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was making a clean-cut
swoop to earth, when the crowd rushed in
right below her. To have kept the craft on its
course would have meant much injury, and possible loss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
of life. On the other hand, Dr. Perkins
knew that in the wind that was blowing it
would be dangerous in the extreme to the air
craft to change her course.
</p>
<p>
“Get out of the way!” he shouted.
</p>
<p>
“Out of the way unless you want to get hurt!”
yelled Frank and Harry.
</p>
<p>
But the crowd, like foolish sheep, only stared
and gaped, and made not the slightest effort to
avoid the on-driving <em>Sea Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p>
There was only one thing to do, and Dr. Perkins
did it. There was a quick twist of his steering
wheel, and the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, instantly obeying
her helm, darted off in an opposite direction to
the one in which she had been advancing. Like
a flash Dr. Perkins pulled the rising lever, at the
same time shouting to Frank to stop the engines
momentarily. He thought that the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
would rise of her own volition, and knew that if
the engines kept driving at top speed that his
craft would be plunged prow first into the earth.
</p>
<p>
So he chose the lesser of the two evils, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
the maneuver might have been successful but
for one thing. There was not room in which to
execute it.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Sea Eagle</em> hesitated, half rose, and then
crashed down to the ground, landing heavily on
one wing tip and smashing it to bits. Frank and
Harry were pitched clean out of the hydroplane
substructure when the impact came, and a cry of
alarm went up from the crowd. But Dr. Perkins
clung to his seat and brought the big craft
to a stop.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately neither Frank nor Harry had been
much injured, beyond being badly shaken up and
bruised, and they were both on their feet again
in a jiffy after the accident. The crowd, as if
realizing that its actions had had a good deal
to do with the accident, forebore to press in, and
they made their way to Dr. Perkins’ side without
difficulty.
</p>
<p>
“Is she much injured?” was Frank’s first question.
</p>
<p>
“By good luck I think we have escaped serious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
damage,” rejoined Dr. Perkins, “but only an examination
can tell.”
</p>
<p>
At this moment a well-dressed, prosperous-looking
man came elbowing through the crowd.
He came straight up to Dr. Perkins with hand
extended.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Perkins!” he exclaimed. “I always told
you you’d have a tumble some time, and now
you’ve had it; right in my back yard, too. But
I’m sincerely glad to see that neither you nor
your machine appears to be much injured.”
</p>
<p>
The newcomer was Mr. James Studley, an old
acquaintance of the inventor’s, who was summering
at Cape May. The doctor was very glad to
see him and accepted his cordial invitation to
spend the night at his house, the boys, of course,
being included in the invitation.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, a squadron of police had arrived,
who drove back the crowds, and arrangements
were made to keep a guard on duty all
night till an examination of the wrecked machine
could be made.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
</p>
<p>
“The accident, if it had to happen, could not
have occurred more conveniently, so to speak,”
Dr. Perkins confided to his companions as they
followed Mr. Studley to a handsome house not
far away. “Mr. Studley is a manufacturer of
aëroplanes, and has started a factory here, so
that very probably we can get material to repair
our damages without much trouble.”
</p>
<p>
This was good news indeed to the boys, who
had begun to fear that the trip might be abandoned.
</p>
<p>
They enjoyed a good dinner and a change into
dry clothes as the guests of Mr. Studley and his
wife, and bright and early the next morning repairs
were made to the splintered wing tip, which
was not so badly damaged as had at first appeared.
Mr. Studley, who had provided workmen
and materials for the task from his aëroplane
factory, refused to hear of any compensation.
</p>
<p>
“Such services should be rendered freely and
gladly by one birdman to another,” he declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
laughingly. “Who knows that some day I may
not drop in on you at your island, in more senses
than one.”
</p>
<p>
As every trace of the storm had vanished, and
the morning was bright and clear, no obstacle opposed
itself to the continuance of their journey
as soon as the repairs had been completed. So
fine was the weather, in fact, that Mr. Studley
declared his intention of accompanying them in
a light “runabout” aëroplane of the monoplane
class, for a short distance.
</p>
<p>
The machine, a pretty little affair of the Bleriot
type, was soon wheeled out, and Mr. Studley
declared all was ready for the start. As on the
evening before, a large crowd had gathered, but
the police kept them back, and gave the two vastly
different aëroplanes a clear field in which to rise.
A greater contrast could not well be imagined
than that presented by the heavy, rather cumbersome-looking
<em>Sea Eagle</em> with her substantial underbody
and huge wing spread, and the trim,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
dainty little monoplane, which was named the
<em>Green Firefly</em>.
</p>
<p>
“We’re all ready when you are,” exclaimed Dr.
Perkins, turning to his friend, who was already
seated in his long-bodied, gauzy-winged air craft.
</p>
<p>
“All right! Clear the way!” cried Mr. Studley
with a wave of his hands.
</p>
<p>
His mechanics gave the propeller of the monoplane
a twirl, as it was not provided with self-starting
mechanism, and a moment later the roaring
fusillade of the <em>Sea Eagle’s</em> motor was
drowning the sharp, angry, hornet-like buzzing
of the <em>Green Firefly</em>.
</p>
<p>
“Go!” yelled Mr. Studley, and simultaneously,
as it seemed, the two sky ships dashed forward
over the smooth sward.
</p>
<p>
“Hooray!” shouted the crowd.
</p>
<p>
“They’re off!” shouted others.
</p>
<p>
And then, a minute later:
</p>
<p>
“Look! They’re going up!”
</p>
<p>
“So they are!” cried the spectators, as if there
was any room for doubt about the matter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
</p>
<p>
The light <em>Firefly</em> was first, by the fraction of
a second, to point her sharp nose up toward the
tranquil blue dome of the sky. But the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
was not tardy in following.
</p>
<p>
“Come on!” shouted Mr. Studley, casting a
swift glance back over his shoulder at his large
comrade of the air. He appeared to think that
he would have little difficulty in distancing the
huge machine.
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t begun yet!” cried Dr. Perkins
back to him, with an answering wave of the
hand.
</p>
<p>
Nor was the <em>Sea Eagle</em> as yet making a quarter
of the speed she was capable of. On account
of her great weight, and general size of her wing
spread, it was not advisable to “open everything
up” at once when she made an ascent from the
land.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Firefly</em> darted ahead like some creature
that rejoiced to be sporting in its element. But
close behind came a roar and whirr as Frank let
out another notch on the <em>Sea Eagle</em>. Up and up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
they flew, while the crowd below dwindled to
pigmies, and the houses looked like so many toy
Noah’s Arks. It was plain enough that Mr.
Studley was engaged in a good-natured effort to
show his friend that the <em>Firefly</em> was an infinitely
faster craft than her cumbersome rival. He
darted this way and that, making spirals and
doing rocking-chair evolutions with the perfection
of aërial grace.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins attempted none of these stunts,
but from time to time he turned back to Frank
and nodded as a signal to give the craft a little
more power.
</p>
<p>
By the time the twin propellers were developing
their top push and speed, the owner of the
<em>Firefly</em> realized that he had a tussle on his hands.
He ceased his graceful evolutions and settled
down to real flying. But he had not gone a mile
over the aërial race track before the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
thundered past him like a “Limited” of the skies.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by and thank you!” Dr. Perkins found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
time to yell, as they flashed past, bound due
south once more.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by. Good luck to you!” came from Mr.
Studley, as he waved his hand in the realization
that he was beaten.
</p>
<p>
There was no time to exchange more words.
In a few minutes the boys, looking back, could
only see a black speck like a shoe button against
the sky to mark where the defeated <em>Firefly</em> was
turning about and heading for home.
</p>
<p>
As for the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, at sixty miles an hour,
and with her motor going faster every minute,
that staunch and speedy craft was winging her
way at top speed for her distant goal.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span><a name='chXXVI' id='chXXVI'></a>CHAPTER XXVI.—THE BOY AVIATORS’ PLUCK.</h2>
<p>
But it was almost a week later that the 1,400
odd miles down the coast to Fernandina, Florida,
and from thence overland to the Crescent City,
were completed. Storms and minor accidents
spun out the voyage to this length, although Dr.
Perkins had calculated on making a faster run.
In fact, his aim had been to make about 500 miles
a day, with night flights to help out, if possible.
</p>
<p>
Many interesting incidents, which it would require
another volume to chronicle in detail,
marked the trip. Off Savannah the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
towed a disabled motor boat, containing a pleasure
party, into port, and a short time later flew
above the Atlantic squadron of the United States
fleet bound south for target practice. Aërial
greetings were exchanged by wireless between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
the <em>Sea Eagle</em> and Uncle Sam’s bulldogs of the
ocean.
</p>
<p>
The next day the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was once more
enabled to render aërial ambulance service by
taking an injured keeper from a lighthouse off
Fernandina into port, and arranging for a substitute
to be sent out at once. At every city they
stopped they received a great reception, for by
this time the flight of the <em>Sea Eagle</em> had received
the attention of the country through the medium
of the newspapers.
</p>
<p>
Possibly one incident may be worth chronicling
in more detail. This occurred when, a
short time after rising for a night flight from
Eufala, Alabama, to the Mississippi State line,
Frank descried, through some trees, what he
thought was the rising moon.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the funniest-looking moon I ever saw,”
declared Harry, who happened to be doing duty
as engineer.
</p>
<p>
“Why, what’s the matter with it?” demanded
Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s red.”
</p>
<p>
“Probably caused by the mist from some
marshlands,” decided Dr. Perkins, who was resting,
while Frank guided the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, at which
he had become quite expert. But the next moment
he changed his opinion.
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t the moon at all. It’s the glare from a
fire, and a big one, too. Let’s hurry up, boys.”
</p>
<p>
Neither Frank nor Harry needed any urging,
and the <em>Sea Eagle</em> was soon traversing the air so
fast that the wind sang in their ears. As they
raced along the glare grew brighter and angrier,
glowing with a lambent red core from which
flames could be seen leaping skyward like a nest
of fiery serpents.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes brought them into full view of
the conflagration. It proved to be a fine old
farm-house. The front of the place was a mass
of flame, and the blaze appeared to be bursting
through the roof. Men could be seen running
about the grounds like a nest of disturbed ants,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
and others were hastening on foot, in autos and
in buggies, from every direction.
</p>
<p>
Nobody paid any attention to the oncoming
aëroplane in the excitement, and when it dropped
to earth on the lawn in front of the blazing
building, there was the liveliest sort of confusion.
Some of the farmers did not know what to make
of the visitor from the skies, but their more enlightened
neighbors soon informed them, and recalled
the newspaper accounts they had read of
the <em>Sea Eagle’s</em> great flight.
</p>
<p>
“Anybody in the building?” shouted Frank,
jumping from the <em>Sea Eagle</em> as the craft came
to a standstill.
</p>
<p>
Nobody answered for a moment, but suddenly,
from the back of the building, came a piercing
scream.
</p>
<p>
“Help! Help!”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, that’s a woman calling!” exclaimed
Frank. “Come on, Harry.”
</p>
<p>
Both boys dashed round to the rear of the
blazing mansion, and there, at a third-story window,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
they saw a woman with a baby in her arms,
leaning out and frantically calling for help.
</p>
<p>
“Get a ladder!” shouted Frank.
</p>
<p>
“No time to hunt for it,” cried Harry. “We’ll
have to try another way.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“See the flat roof of that coach house over
there? If we had a board we could make a
bridge from it to the window.”
</p>
<p>
“But how are we to get to the roof of the
coach house?”
</p>
<p>
“Fly there.”
</p>
<p>
“What! in the <em>Sea Eagle</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“Why not? The roof is flat and big enough
to give us room to land if we are careful.”
</p>
<p>
“Cracky! I think you’re right. Has anybody
got a board?”
</p>
<p>
“Here you are,” exclaimed a man who had
darted off to a lumber pile when he overheard
Harry’s plan.
</p>
<p>
“Good! I think this will be long enough.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
Come on, Harry, let’s lose no time. See, the
flames are almost at that part of the house.”
</p>
<p>
At top speed the two boys ran back to the <em>Sea
Eagle</em>, calling to Dr. Perkins to join them. Hastily
they explained what they meant to do. Dr.
Perkins was inclined to doubt if the plan was
feasible, but as it appeared to be the only way
to save the woman and the child, he agreed to
attempt it, grave though the risk of disaster to
the <em>Sea Eagle</em> appeared to be.
</p>
<p>
While the excited men gathered about, and the
woman’s cries still filled the air, the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
was started up, and after circling about, dropped
to the coach house roof. The big craft landed
without mishap, but Frank reversed the engines
barely in time to prevent her from rolling off.
However, with the front wheels of the substructure
on the very brink of the cornice, the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> came obediently to a standstill.
</p>
<p>
They had brought the board with them, and it
was shoved across to the woman, who saw at
once what they intended to do. She secured it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
to the ledge of the window at which she had
been standing, and Frank worked his way across
the plank bridge and took the child in his arms.
He recrossed in safety with it, and then came
the woman’s turn to trust herself to the frail
bridge. But she hesitated till smoke was pouring
into the room, and then, fairly driven to try
the slender support, she began to cross it.
</p>
<p>
From the coach house roof the boys called encouragingly
to her, for the plank was far too
weak to bear the weight of two persons. Even
under Frank and the baby it had sagged ominously.
Something in the woman’s face as she
neared the end of her journey caused Frank to
reach out toward her. It was well that he had
the foresight to do so, for as she reached the end
of her journey she suddenly fainted.
</p>
<p>
Another instant and she would have fallen
forty feet to the ground, but Frank caught her
dress in a strong grip. Luckily, it was of stout
material and did not rip as he seized it. Dr.
Perkins and Harry came to his aid the next minute,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
and with their united strength they managed
to draw the woman’s limp form to safety.
</p>
<p>
Hardly had they done so before the flames began
breaking out fiercely from the back of the
house, and, driven by the strong wind, they were
uncomfortably close to the coach house roof. No
time was lost in placing the woman and her infant
in the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, after which the air craft
was started. Dr. Perkins rose to a suitable
height from which to make a safe descent, and
then swept down to the ground, carrying the first
woman and child in the history of the world to
be saved from a blazing building by aëroplane.
</p>
<p>
The woman soon recovered after some friends
of the neighborhood had taken her and her child
to a nearby dwelling.
</p>
<p>
The owner of the building, and the husband
of the woman who had been so bravely rescued,
now came bustling up, his face beaming with
gratitude. At the moment he was not thinking
of the fire but of the brave strangers from the
sky who had saved his wife and child.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know who you are, or where you
came from,” he exclaimed, “but you literally
dropped from the skies when all hope appeared
lost. I was in town buying stock, and on my way
out I saw the flames coming from my home.
Knowing my wife and child had retired I dreaded
to think what would have happened if they had
not been aroused. I arrived here in time to find
my worst fears realized. How can I ever thank
you for what you have done?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we only tried to do what we could,” said
Frank modestly; “we saw the fire and came down
to see if we couldn’t help.”
</p>
<p>
“I owe the lives of my wife and child to your
quickness and courage, and that wonderful airship
of yours,” vehemently declared the man,
whose name was Winfield Thomas, a wealthy
farmer. “It was a real blessing you happened
along as you did.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins and the boys could only repeat
how glad they were to have done what they could.
Without waiting much longer, except to congratulate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
Mrs. Thomas on her quick recovery, and
to express the hope that she would feel no bad
effects from her experience, the voyage was
shortly resumed. But the adventure at the burning
farm house long remained in the boys’ memory,
and strengthened their attachment to the
<em>Sea Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p>
Nearing New Orleans they caught a wireless
message from Billy Barnes telling them that he
had secured quarters for the <em>Sea Eagle</em> in Algiers,
a suburb across the river from the city.
That night one stage of the trip was concluded
when, in answer to a signal given with a blue
lamp, they dropped into a field on the outskirts
of Algiers and housed the <em>Sea Eagle</em> in a large
barn.
</p>
<p>
“Thunder and turtles!” cried Pudge when that
night in the St. Charles Hotel they were relating
their adventures. “You fellows have all the fun
and we do all the work.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, Pudge,” said Frank; “I guess
we’ll have adventures in plenty ahead of us when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
we try to locate the wreck of the <em>Belle of New
Orleans</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Which will be as soon as possible,” said Dr.
Perkins. “Our trip has taken us longer than I
anticipated, and there is a strong chance that
Duval may have got ahead of us.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s another reason for hurrying,” declared
Billy, who had just wired to his paper a
long account of the <em>Sea Eagle’s</em> trip; “they say
that the river is rising. There have been unprecedented
rainstorms and the levees are weakening.
Negroes are at work on them all along
the line, but they doubt if they can make them
hold if the river keeps rising.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span><a name='chXXVII' id='chXXVII'></a>CHAPTER XXVII.—CAPTURED BY AËROPLANE.</h2>
<p>
During the short time that they had been in
the city Ben Stubbs and his two young companions
had done wonders in the way of collecting
equipment for the purpose of rifling the treasure
which it was expected lay in the submerged hulk
of the <em>Belle of New Orleans</em>. A diving suit with
pumping apparatus of the latest type, blocks and
tackles and hand spikes were among the things
laid in stock. Ben had also invested in a new
device, a submarine searchlight. The choice of
this last was warmly approved by Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“I was wondering how it would be possible
to find one’s way about the sunken ship without
some such article,” he said approvingly, and old
Ben’s rugged face glowed with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“Trust an old timer, sir, for remembering
those things,” he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, nobody could have selected a more
complete outfit,” rejoined Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
The inventory of the goods was taken the next
morning, and hiring a boat the stuff was transported
to Algiers, where the <em>Sea Eagle</em> had been
looked after over night by a couple of darkies.
</p>
<p>
As they crossed the river in a hired boat they
noticed how swiftly the current ran and how discolored
it was. The negro who rowed them commented
on it, too.
</p>
<p>
“Dey be po’ful big flood befo’ long, genelmen,”
he opined, “an’ when ole man Mississip’ git up
on his hind lags ain’t nuffin’ kin stop him. Dem
lebees dey go jes lak so much straw er hay.”
</p>
<p>
“All the more reason for our making haste,”
said Dr. Perkins, addressing the others; “it would
be hard fortune indeed if Ben were to be robbed
of his fortune by a flood.”
</p>
<p>
The shed which had sheltered the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
overnight was close to the water’s edge so that
the goods were soon transported on board. All
was found to be in good shape, and the two darkies,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
who had watched the air craft overnight, received
an extra gratuity for their pains. The
adventurers had been particular not to give out
any details of their flight, and it was expected
that they would stay in New Orleans for some
days before proceeding, so that no curious crowd,
only a few negroes and stragglers, were on hand
to see them start.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins had an excellent chart of the river,
showing distinctly the location of Black Bayou,
which lay back from the river amidst a maze of
other wriggly creeks and water courses. The
<em>Belle of New Orleans</em> had been on her way to a
“far back” plantation to pick up cotton, when she
blew up, which accounted for the wreck being
submerged in such an out of the way place.
</p>
<p>
As they flew along the river, but far above it,
they could see human beings, busy as ants, working
along the levees, strengthening them against
the dreaded floods which already had devastated
whole sections of country in Ohio and farther up
the mighty stream. At length the course of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
<em>Sea Eagle</em> was changed till she was flying over a
perfect maze of water courses and bayous, winding
in and out of a dense forest. From above, it
looked like a lace work of water overlying a piece
of dark green plush.
</p>
<p>
But the map showed a landmark for Black
Bayou. Harry’s plan was marked “Ruined plantation
house and sugar mill.” Frank was the
first to spy out this important “bearing.” The
<em>Sea Eagle</em> was at that time not very far up, and
the gaunt walls and desolate overgrown buildings
of the once prosperous place could be seen clearly.
“Giant cypress with three forks,” was the next
marking, and, sure enough, on a little patch of
an island, not far from the ruined plantation,
they presently saw a gaunt dead tree answering
this description.
</p>
<p>
“Bayous and bullfrogs! We’re getting hot
now!” cried Pudge excitedly. “Ben, I believe
that that rascal was telling the truth after all.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m inclined to think so, too, Master Pudge,”
rejoined Ben; “and look—look there—that must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
be the Catfish Island marked on the plan. See,
it’s just the shape of one of them critters.”
</p>
<p>
“So it is, Ben,” cried Frank, peering down.
“Goodness, this <em>is</em> exciting, though. Just think,
in a short time we shall know if our flight for a
fortune is——”
</p>
<p>
“A fizzle or not,” interrupted the slangy
Pudge.
</p>
<p>
“Right off Catfish Island two points to the
north,” read out Harry.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Perkins glanced at the compass and
slightly altered the direction of the <em>Sea Eagle;</em>
then he allowed the great craft to drop gently to
rest on the waters of Black Bayou.
</p>
<p>
Harry referred to the plan again.
</p>
<p>
“North a hundred yards to the Lone Pine
Island.”
</p>
<p>
“There it is,” cried Frank, indicating a small
spot of land on which a dead pine reared its bare
trunk.
</p>
<p>
Hardly had he spoken when a canoe shot round
a bend in a small bayou just ahead of them, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
a wild-looking man, who had been paddling it,
checked his frail craft. His unkempt whiskers
covered him almost to his waist, and his clothes
were ragged to a degree. But none of them
thought of this as the swamp dweller so unexpectedly
came into view.
</p>
<p>
“Is this the Black Bayou?” they cried almost
in chorus.
</p>
<p>
The other nodded and stared wildly and half
in alarm at the strange-looking craft that confronted
him.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Oui!</em> Thees Black Bayou,” he rejoined in
soft, broken accents; “what you want, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever hear tell of the <em>Belle of New
Orleans?</em>” asked Ben, in a voice that shook with
suppressed excitement.
</p>
<p>
To his astonishment the Acadian—for the
weird figure in the boat was one of those strange
dwellers of the cypress swamps—burst into a
loud laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Oh ho! Oh ho!” he cackled; “what you want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
wid zee <em>Belle of New Orleans</em>, eh? What you
want weez her?”
</p>
<p>
Ben hesitated, and before he could reply the
other burst into another weird cackling laugh,
and held up a small object.
</p>
<p>
“You want zee pearl, zee gold, hey? Zey all
gone! See, I have one. Zee men who come here
two day ago give it me for help zem. Adieu!”
</p>
<p>
Before anybody on the <em>Sea Eagle</em> could utter
a word the fellow gave a deft stroke of his paddle
and his canoe shot off into the trackless paths of
the swamps.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what under the sun!” burst out Frank,
while Pudge weakly ejaculated:
</p>
<p>
“Centipedes and spongecakes!”
</p>
<p>
“It’s all clear enough,” exclaimed Ben bitterly.
“Those ruffians got ahead of us. That ’Cadian
took them to the scene of the wreck and they’ve
rifled it.”
</p>
<p>
“That was undoubtedly a black pearl he held
up,” said Dr. Perkins in a faint voice. “I suppose
they gave him that for guiding them here.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
</p>
<p>
The sudden shriek of a high-crested kingfisher
made them look up suddenly. The bird
was darting from tree to tree on an island at a
little distance. Suddenly something that lay at
the foot of a tree caught Ben’s sharp eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that? That glittering thing yonder?”
he exclaimed, pointing.
</p>
<p>
“Easy enough to see,” said Dr. Perkins, starting
up the <em>Sea Eagle</em> for the little island.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a diving helmet!” cried Frank as they
drew closer to the object, “just look, the rascals
must have left it there after they got the treasure
out of the sunken wreck. I guess they
thought that as they were so rich they need not
bother with it.”
</p>
<p>
They landed on the island as disconsolate and
downcast a band of treasure hunters as ever set
foot on the site of a treasure trove. Abundant
evidences of a camp were all about them. The
ashes of a fire, and scraps of food and paper.
One of these caught Frank’s attention. It was
a fragment of newspaper, and what had challenged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
Frank’s notice was that a band of red ink
had been drawn around some printing on it.
Frank read the marked portion with a somewhat
vague curiosity. For the moment he did not
realize what an important clew he had stumbled
upon. Then it rushed upon him with full force.
</p>
<p>
Ben and the others were on the shore of the
island pointing down into the muddy waters of
the bayou.
</p>
<p>
The earth was trampled in the vicinity, and
showed plainly that the miscreants who had
stolen the treasure had carried on their operations
from that point of the bank.
</p>
<p>
“Down thar somewhar’ lies the wreck of the
<em>Belle of New Orleans</em>,” said Ben, shaking his
head dolefully, and pointing into the black current;
“but it ain’t going to do us no good, mates.
It ain’t going to do us no good; them sea skunks
has got ahead of us for fair.”
</p>
<p>
It was at this point that Frank’s shout interrupted
them.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” cried Dr. Perkins.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
</p>
<p>
“This paper. Come here. I think it’s a clew
to where they have gone.”
</p>
<p>
They crowded about him while Frank read out
from the marked paper.
</p>
<p>
“‘The new South American Commerce Company’s
steamer <em>Buenos Aires</em> sails to-morrow for
the latter port. She is a fast, capable craft and
will make a direct run to the Argentine. The
inauguration of this service is a distinct addition
to the commercial importance of New Orleans
and establishes new trade relations with South
America.’”
</p>
<p>
“Very pretty,” said Ben; “but what does it
prove?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I don’t see much of a clew in that,” put
in Harry.
</p>
<p>
But Frank raised his hand to command silence.
</p>
<p>
“Listen a minute,” he said. “Of course, I may
be altogether wrong, but it seems to me that the
reason this paragraph is marked is because those
fellows meant to sail on this very boat.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
</p>
<p>
Ben brought his hand down on his knee with a
resounding whack.
</p>
<p>
“By hookey, lad!” he roared; “that’s reason.
That’s solid sense and reason.”
</p>
<p>
“What is the date of that paper?” asked Dr.
Perkins.
</p>
<p>
“Luckily the paragraph was torn off from the
top of the page,” said Frank, “and the date of
the issue is legible. It is dated yesterday.”
</p>
<p>
“Then the <em>Buenos Aires</em> sailed this morning?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; that’s the way it looks.”
</p>
<p>
“And while we are wasting time here she is
heading down the river for the open sea,”
groaned Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t we wireless to New Orleans and find
out?” asked Pudge.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a mighty good idea, Pudge,” said his
father, “but the set we have on the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
wouldn’t carry as far as that.”
</p>
<p>
“Then let’s get on board again and fly back as
quickly as possible. We are only wasting time
here,” said Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
</p>
<p>
His suggestion was quickly acted upon, and
the voyagers reëmbarked. They were a very
different party from the pleasantly excited expedition
that had set out that morning so full of
hope and enterprise. Frank alone kept up his
spirits. He sat constantly at the wireless as they
winged their way back to New Orleans, incessantly
trying to get into communication.
</p>
<p>
At last he caught the operator of the Harbor
Master’s office. Instantly he flashed his
query:
</p>
<p>
“Did <em>Buenos Aires</em> sail this a. m.?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Ship sailed early to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“Where will she be now?”
</p>
<p>
“About off Fort Jackson, near the mouth of
the river,” came the reply. “She has wireless,
but it is out of order, so that I can’t tell you exactly
where she is right now.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks!” flashed Frank and disconnected.
</p>
<p>
He quickly communicated his tidings, and immediately
a hasty, excited consultation followed.
The result of it was that Dr. Perkins decided to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
ground the <em>Sea Eagle</em> in Algiers. This done, Ben
would swear out a warrant before the most available
justice, and then, if they could find a deputy
nervy enough to make the trip, he was to be taken
on board the <em>Sea Eagle</em> and the <em>Buenos Aires</em>
overtaken before she got beyond the jurisdiction
of the State.
</p>
<p>
But after landing in Algiers these plans were
changed. It was decided instead to swear out a
federal warrant, as there was grave danger of
the ship getting out of the State’s power before
they could overtake her. On the extraordinary
circumstances being related to him, the U. S.
Commissioner at New Orleans readily granted
the warrant for the arrest of all three of the
rascals. It now remained only to find a Deputy
U. S. Marshal courageous enough to make the
trip through the air.
</p>
<p>
The only one available seemed a bit doubtful.
</p>
<p>
“A trip in an aëroplane!” he said. “I’ve never
taken such a journey and I’m scared of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
blessed things. You see, I’ve got a wife and
family, and——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be afraid. There’s really no danger,
and we’ll be over water most of the way,” urged
Dr. Perkins.
</p>
<p>
The deputy seemed to come to a sudden conclusion.
His eyes snapped and his lips tightened.
</p>
<p>
“All right, I’ll go with you!” he suddenly cried.
“Wait till I ’phone the missus and I’m your man.
Those rascals played you a mean trick, and I’d
like to see you win out.”
</p>
<p>
The hearts of the adventurers gave a bound
of hope. There was a chance of seeing justice
come into its own, after all.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
The <em>Buenos Aires</em>, a fine ship of five thousand
or more tons, dropped rapidly down the river.
She had few cabin passengers, and of these only
three were on deck. The remainder were in their
cabins putting their belongings to rights.
</p>
<p>
These three men were the elder Daniels, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
loutish son and Duval. But they all wore smart
new clothes, and Duval had shaved off his mustache.
As for the two Daniels, it is an example
of what clothes can do to say that they looked
more like prosperous, rather countryfied commission
dealers than rugged fishermen from Maine.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s have a look at them pearls again,” Daniels
was saying, after he had given a cautious
glance about him to make sure they were not
observed.
</p>
<p>
Duval reached into his pocket and drew out a
canvas bag. From it he poured out a number of
black, lustrous objects, catching them in a cupped
hand.
</p>
<p>
“Twenty of the beauties,” he exclaimed;
“twenty black pearls—the rarest gems that come
out of the ocean.”
</p>
<p>
“What are they worth again?” asked the elder
Daniels, licking his lips anticipatively.
</p>
<p>
“Thirty thousand dollars at the least.”
</p>
<p>
“Jiminy! Hold me, some one!” sputtered Zeb.
</p>
<p>
“And that, counting the gold dust in the cabin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
makes a fortune of close upon seventy-five thousand
dollars we got out of that old hulk, don’t
it?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” answered Duval; “you fellows
did a good day’s work for yourselves when you
knocked me on the head in that hut.”
</p>
<p>
“Waal, I should say so. Let’s go below and
look at that gold again. I kin hardly keep my
fingers frum touching it. We’re rich, boys, we’re
rich!”
</p>
<p>
The three worthies disappeared below after
Duval had carefully replaced the black pearls in
their bag. It was some hours later when they
came up again and the ship was passing the Port
Ead’s light.
</p>
<p>
“We’re safe now,” exclaimed Duval in a low
tone; “even if they do discover the trick we’ve
put up on em, they could never catch us now. In
another two hours we’ll be out on the gulf and by
to-morrow we’ll be out of reach of any one in
Yankeeland.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hulloo, what’s up astern?” asked Zeb suddenly.
“What are they all pointing at?”
</p>
<p>
“Pointing at? What do you mean?” demanded
Duval, suspicious as are most guilty consciences
of anything unusual.
</p>
<p>
“Something in the sky. Hark! They are
shouting!”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Something in the sky!</em>”
</p>
<p>
Duval’s face went white. His knees shook.
By a flash of guilty intuition he had guessed what
that something was, even if the next minute a
shout had not split the air.
</p>
<p>
“An aëroplane! It’s an aëroplane!”
</p>
<p>
Duval’s knees quivered under him. He trembled
like a man with the palsy. Old Daniels came
up to him hastily.
</p>
<p>
“Duval, they’ve sighted one of them airyoplanes—you
don’t think——”
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t <em>think</em>. I know,” choked out Duval,
“they are after us. Hark!”
</p>
<p>
From the distance came the sound of shots
high up in the air. In reply to the signal—for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
such it was—the <em>Buenos Aires’</em> whistle emitted
three long, mournful toots. Her engines began
to slow down. As Duval felt the steamer’s speed
check he dashed below to his cabin. As for Daniels,
he stood rooted to the spot, his lips moving,
but no speech coming from them. Zeb was nowhere
to be seen.
</p>
<p>
Up on the <em>Buenos Aires’</em> lofty flying bridge
her officers, in the meantime, had been almost
equally excited. They had seen the aëroplane
some time before; but as nowadays such craft
are a fairly common sight, they had not paid
overmuch attention to it. It was not till the
unusual size of the craft was revealed that they
scrutinized it closely.
</p>
<p>
Then, as the big winged man-bird swung above
the steamer’s masts, had come the quick six pistol
shots. An imperative signal, rightly interpreted
“Stop!”
</p>
<p>
The whistle had replied and the vessel’s way
been checked as the jangling signals sounded in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
the engine-room, and “Slow down” flashed up
on the telegraph.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want?” hailed the captain
through a megaphone, as the <em>Sea Eagle</em>—for of
course our readers have guessed the identity of
the craft of the air—swung above him.
</p>
<p>
“We want to board you with a United States
warrant!” came the startling reply from midair.
</p>
<p>
“A warrant! For some of my passengers?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; for three men whom we have reason to
believe booked passage as Daniel Maine and son
and another one who calls himself Francis Le
Blanc.”
</p>
<p>
“I have three such men on board and recognize
the authority of the United States. How will
you board me?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll come alongside.”
</p>
<p>
The captain looked as if he didn’t understand
how this was going to be done, but gave orders
to stop the ship, drop anchor and lower the gangway.
This was done, and the <em>Sea Eagle</em> dropped
to the water alongside with perfect precision. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
the meantime, the wildest excitement reigned on
board. Rumors flew thick and fast as to the errand
of the men from the air.
</p>
<p>
Lest it should be wondered how Dr. Perkins
and his companions knew the names under which
the three rascals had sailed, we had better clear
this matter up. Before embarking in the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> in pursuit of the <em>Buenos Aires</em>, a passenger
list had been obtained from the offices of the
steamship company. It will be recalled that
Francis Le Blanc was the alias, or false name,
which Duval had used when in the employ of
Mr. Sterrett on the yacht <em>Wanderer</em>. This gave
them a clew, and when they came across the
names Daniel Maine and son, booked for an adjoining
cabin, there remained small doubt that
those names concealed the two Daniels.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Sea Eagle</em> was soon made fast, and Marshal
Howell, followed by Dr. Perkins and the two
Boy Aviators, sprang up the gangway. The
others they had been compelled to leave behind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
as, with the three prisoners to carry back, the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> would have been overcrowded.
</p>
<p>
As they reached the top of the gangway Captain
Stow and his officers advanced to meet them.
</p>
<p>
“To what am I indebted for the honor of this
visit?” asked the seaman.
</p>
<p>
The marshal showed his authority and his warrant.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t wish to detain you longer than necessary,
captain,” he said, “so will you have us
shown to their cabins?”
</p>
<p>
The captain himself led the way below, and
conducted them down a corridor to the stern of
the ship. As they reached the end of the passage
a door was thrust suddenly open and a bullet
whizzed past Frank’s head. At the same instant
Zeb’s figure appeared in the doorway.
</p>
<p>
But before he could fire another shot the marshal
had wrested the pistol from him and burst
into the cabin. Frank was close behind him. At
a port hole was Duval; he had something in his
hand and was just about to hurl it out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
port hole, when Frank, in one bound, was at his
side and had his arm captive. With a snarl like
a wounded wild beast Duval turned on him, whipping
out a knife as he did so. But before any
harm could be done, Dr. Perkins seized and disarmed
him.
</p>
<p>
It was speedily found that the bag which
Frank had saved was the one containing the
black pearls which Duval, in his extremity, had
determined to throw away rather than let any
one else gain their possession. The Marshal
slipped the handcuffs on Zeb and Duval, who
submitted sullenly to arrest. It was not till then
that their thoughts turned to the elder Daniels.
He was not in his cabin, and search of the ship
failed to reveal him. The mystery was soon to
be explained, however.
</p>
<p>
A boat with a colored oarsman had been lying
alongside the steamer waiting to take off the
pilot. In the confusion old Daniels had opened
the bag of gold dust, selected a packet, and, dropping
into the boat, told the negro to row him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
ashore to secure help for the officers. The negro
naturally supposed that he was acting under
proper instructions, and put the old fisherman
ashore. He was never heard of again.
</p>
<p>
Zeb and Duval sullenly refused to utter a
word, but ultimately, after their return to New
Orleans, Frank had an interview with Duval in
his prison cell, in which he made a clean breast of
everything. From Bayhaven they had hastened
south by fast trains, stopping on the way to buy
diving dress. The Acadian whom the boys had
encountered in the swamps had guided them to
the scene of the wreck, receiving one black pearl
as his reward.
</p>
<p>
Of the voyage back from the <em>Buenos Aires</em>
with the two prisoners not much can be said. It
was made at a good rate of speed, and both
Duval and Zeb were docile. Indeed, there was
no use in their being otherwise. On account of
his youth and the pleadings of Dr. Perkins and
the boys, Zeb got a light sentence in a reformatory
institution, and it is hoped that he will prove
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
a far better character when he gets out. Duval
was more severely dealt with, but even he got off
more lightly than he deserved, thanks to the
clemency of the people he had wronged.
</p>
<p>
And so ends the story of the Boy Aviators’
Flight for a Fortune in the most wonderful aëroplane
constructed up to date. But no doubt, in
the rapid march of events, even the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
will soon be surpassed. Already, while this book
goes to press, plans are being made by no less
than four separate aviators to dare the terrors of
a transatlantic passage. Whether they will succeed
or not is in the lap of the future, but the
author is certain that some day flights across
“The Pond” at seventy or eighty miles an hour
will be so common as to attract but small attention.
</p>
<p>
Some of my readers doubtless wish to know
how Ben disposed of his fortune. Well, part of
it he wisely invested in real estate, and the rest
he is thinking of putting into the company Dr.
Perkins has formed to manufacture <em>Sea Eagles</em>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
Mr. Sterrett is a member of the company, and so
are the Boy Aviators. Naturally Ben’s keen wish
to have them share some of his good fortune was
refused, for, as we know, the Boy Aviators’ adventures
in the past had netted them a good
share of this world’s goods. Billy Barnes is publicity
agent at a good salary for the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
Company, Ltd., and the work just suits his
tastes. As for Pudge, he is as hard a worker as
anybody at the plant on Brig Island, learning
the business “from the bottom up.”
</p>
<p>
And so, wishing them well in their future undertakings,
we will here take leave for the present
of our friends, until we hear of them again
in the next volume, entitled “The Boy Aviators
with the Air Raiders.”

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
The launching of this Twentieth Century series marks
the inauguration of a new era in boys’ books—the
“wonders of modern science” epoch. Frank and Harry
Chester, the <span class='sc'>Boy Aviators</span>, are the heroes of this exciting,
red-blooded tale of adventure by air and land in
the turbulent Central American republic. The two
brothers with their $10,000 prize aeroplane, the <span class='sc'>Golden
Eagle</span>, rescue a chum from death in the clutches of the
Nicaraguans, discover a lost treasure valley of the ancient
Toltec race, and in so doing almost lose their own
lives in the Abyss of the White Serpents, and have many
other exciting experiences, including being blown far
out to sea in their air-skimmer in a tropical storm. It
would be unfair to divulge the part that wireless plays
in rescuing them from their predicament. In a brand
new field of fiction for boys the Chester brothers and
their aeroplane seem destined to fill a top-notch place.
These books are technically correct, wholesomely thrilling
and geared up to third speed.

THE BOY AVIATORS ON SECRET SERVICE
</p>
<p>
Or, Working With Wireless
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
In this live-wire narrative of peril and adventure,
laid in the Everglades of Florida, the
spunky Chester Boys and their interesting
chums, including Ben Stubbs, the maroon,
encounter exciting experiences on Uncle Sam’s
service in a novel field. One must read this
vivid, enthralling story of incident, hardship
and pluck to get an idea of the almost limitless
possibilities of the two greatest inventions
of modern times—the aeroplane and wireless
telegraphy. While gripping and holding the
reader’s breathless attention from the opening
words to the finish, this swift-moving story is
at the same time instructive and uplifting. As
those readers who have already made friends
with Frank and Harry Chester and their
“bunch” know, there are few difficulties, no
matter how insurmountable they may seem at
first blush, that these up-to-date gritty youths
cannot overcome with flying colors. A clean-cut,
real boys’ book of high voltage.

THE BOY AVIATORS IN AFRICA
</p>
<p>
Or, An Aerial Ivory Trail
</p>
<p>
In this absorbing book we meet, on a Continent made
famous by the American explorer Stanley, and ex-President
Roosevelt, our old friends, the Chester Boys and
their stalwart chums. In Africa—the Dark Continent—the
author follows in exciting detail his young heroes,
their voyage in the first aeroplane to fly above the mysterious
forests and unexplored ranges of the mystic land.
In this book, too, for the first time, we entertain Luther
Barr, the old New York millionaire, who proved later
such an implacable enemy of the boys. The story of his
defeated schemes, of the astonishing things the boys discovered
in the Mountains of the Moon, of the pathetic
fate of George Desmond, the emulator of Stanley, the
adventure of the Flying Men and the discovery of the
Arabian Ivory cache,—this is not the place to speak. It
would be spoiling the zest of an exciting tale to reveal
the outcome of all these episodes here. It may be said,
however, without “giving away” any of the thrilling
chapters of this narrative, that Captain Wilbur Lawton,
the author, is in it in his best vein, and from his personal
experiences in Africa has been able to supply a striking
background for the adventures of his young heroes. As
one newspaper says of this book: “Here is adventure in
good measure, pressed down and running over.”

THE BOY AVIATORS TREASURE QUEST
</p>
<p>
Or, The Golden Galleon
</p>
<p>
Everybody is a boy once more when it comes to the
question of hidden treasure. In this book, Captain Lawton
has set forth a hunt for gold that is concealed neither
under the sea nor beneath the earth, but is well hidden
for all that. A garrulous old sailor, who holds the key
to the mystery of the Golden Galleon, plays a large
part in the development of the plot of this fascinating
narrative of treasure hunting in the region of the Gulf
Stream and the Sargasso Sea. An aeroplane fitted with efficient
pontoons—enabling her to skim the water successfully—has
long been a dream of aviators. The Chester
Boys seem to have solved the problem. The Sargasso
that strange drifting ocean within an ocean, holding ships
of a dozen nations and a score of ages, in its relentless
grip, has been the subject of many books of adventure
and mystery, but in none has the secret of the ever
shifting mass of treacherous currents been penetrated as
it has in the BOY AVIATORS TREASURE QUEST.
Luther Barr, whom it seemed the boys had shaken off,
is still on their trail, in this absorbing book and with a
dirigible balloon, essays to beat them out in their search
for the Golden Galleon. Every boy, every man—and
woman and girl—who has ever felt the stirring summons
of adventure in their souls, had better get hold of this
book. Once obtained, it will be read and re-read till
it falls to rags.

THE BOY AVIATORS IN RECORD FLIGHT
</p>
<p>
Or, The Rival Aeroplane
</p>
<p>
The Chester Boys in new field of endeavor—an attempt
to capture a newspaper prize for a trans-continental flight.
By the time these lines are read, exactly such an offer
will have been spread broadcast by one of the foremost
newspapers of the country. In the Golden Eagle, the
boys, accompanied by a trail-blazing party in an automobile,
make the dash. But they are not alone in their
aspirations. Their rivals for the rich prize at stake try
in every way that they can to circumvent the lads and
gain the valuable trophy and monetary award. In this
they stop short at nothing, and it takes all the wits and
resources of the Boy Aviators to defeat their devices.
Among the adventures encountered in their cross-country
flight, the boys fall in with a band of rollicking cowboys—who
momentarily threaten serious trouble—are attacked
by Indians, strike the most remarkable town of the
desert—the “dry” town of “Gow Wells,” encounter a
sandstorm which blows them into strange lands far to the
south of their course, and meet with several amusing
mishaps beside. A thoroughly readable book. The sort
to take out behind the barn on the sunny side of the haystack,
and, with a pocketful of juicy apples and your heels
kicking the air, pass happy hours with Captain Lawton’s
young heroes.

THE BOY AVIATORS POLAR DASH
</p>
<p>
Or, Facing Death in the Antarctic
</p>
<p>
If you were to hear that two boys, accompanying a South
Polar expedition in charge of the aeronautic department,
were to penetrate the Antarctic regions—hitherto only
attained by a few daring explorers—you would feel interested,
wouldn’t you? Well, in Captain Lawton’s latest
book, concerning his Boy Aviators, you can not only read
absorbing adventure in the regions south of the eightieth
parallel, but absorb much useful information as well.
Captain Lawton introduces—besides the original characters
of the heroes—a new creation in the person of Professor
Simeon Sandburr, a patient seeker for polar insects.
The professor’s adventures in his quest are the
cause of much merriment, and lead once or twice to
serious predicaments. In a volume so packed with incident
and peril from cover to cover—relieved with laughable
mishaps to the professor—it is difficult to single out any
one feature; still, a recent reader of it wrote the publishers
an enthusiastic letter the other day, saying: “The
episodes above the Great Barrier are thrilling, the attack
of the condors in Patagonia made me hold my breath,
the—but what’s the use? The Polar Dash, to my mind,
is an even more entrancing book than Captain Lawton’s
previous efforts, and that’s saying a good deal. The aviation
features and their technical correctness are by no
means the least attractive features of this up-to-date
creditable volume.”

and the story of their serious, purposeful inventions
challenge the reader’s deepest attention.

makes a lively narrative for lively boys.

A real treasure hunt of the most
thrilling kind, with a sunken Spanish

Among the volunteers accepted for Aero Service are Ned

<p>
THE MOTOR RANGERS’ LOST MINE.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
This is an absorbing story of the
continuous adventures of a motor
car in the hands of Nat Trevor and
his friends. It does seemingly impossible
“stunts,” and yet everything
happens “in the nick of time.”
</p>
<p>
THE MOTOR RANGERS THROUGH THE SIERRAS.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
Enemies in ambush, the peril of
fire, and the guarding of treasure
make exciting times for the Motor
Rangers—yet there is a strong flavor of fun and freedom,
with a typical Western mountaineer for spice.
</p>
<p>
THE MOTOR RANGERS ON BLUE WATER; or, The Secret of the Derelict.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
The strange adventures of the sturdy craft “Nomad” and

From the “Nomad” to the “Discoverer,” from the sea to
the sky, the scene changes in which the Motor Rangers figure.
They have experiences “that never were on land or sea,”
in heat and cold and storm, over mountain peak and lost
city, with savages and reptiles; their ship of the air is attacked
by huge birds of the air; they survive explosion and
earthquake; they even live to tell the tale!

</p>
<p>
THE GIRL AVIATORS AND THE PHANTOM AIRSHIP.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
Roy Prescott was fortunate in
having a sister so clever and devoted
to him and his interests that
they could share work and play
with mutual pleasure and to mutual
advantage. This proved especially
true in relation to the manufacture
and manipulation of their aeroplane,
and Peggy won well deserved
fame for her skill and good
sense as an aviator. There were
many stumbling-blocks in their terrestrial path but they
soared above them all to ultimate success.
</p>
<p>
THE GIRL AVIATORS ON GOLDEN WINGS.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
That there is a peculiar fascination about aviation that
wins and holds girl enthusiasts as well as boys is proved
by this tale. On golden wings the girl aviators rose for
many an exciting flight, and met strange and unexpected
experiences.
</p>
<p>
THE GIRL AVIATORS’ SKY CRUISE.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
To most girls a coaching or yachting trip is an adventure.
How much more perilous an adventure a “sky
cruise” might be is suggested by the title and proved by
the story itself.
</p>
<p>
THE GIRL AVIATORS’ MOTOR BUTTERFLY.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
The delicacy of flight suggested by the word “butterfly,”
the mechanical power implied by “motor,” the ability to,
control assured in the title “aviator,” all combined with
the personality and enthusiasm of girls themselves, make
this story one for any girl or other reader “to go crazy
over.”

<p>
THE MOTOR MAIDS’ SCHOOL DAYS.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
Billie Campbell was just the type
of a straightforward, athletic girl
to be successful as a practical
Motor Maid. She took her car, as
she did her class-mates, to her
heart, and many a grand good time
did they have all together. The
road over which she ran her
red machine had many an unexpected
turning,—now it led her
into peculiar danger; now into contact
with strange travelers; and again into experiences
by fire and water. But, best of all, “The Comet” never
failed its brave girl owner.
</p>
<p>
THE MOTOR MAIDS BY PALM AND PINE.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
Wherever the Motor Maids went there were lively times,
for these were companionable girls who looked upon the
world as a vastly interesting place full of unique adventures—and
so, of course, they found them.
</p>
<p>
THE MOTOR MAIDS ACROSS THE CONTINENT.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
It is always interesting to travel, and it is wonderfully
entertaining to see old scenes through fresh eyes. It is
that privilege, therefore, that makes it worth while to join
the Motor Maids in their first ’cross-country run.
</p>
<p>
THE MOTOR MAIDS BY ROSE, SHAMROCK AND HEATHER.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
South and West had the Motor Maids motored, nor
could their education by travel have been more wisely
begun. But now a speaking acquaintance with their own
country enriched their anticipation of an introduction to
the British Isles. How they made their polite American
bow and how they were received on the other side is a
tale of interest and inspiration.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
